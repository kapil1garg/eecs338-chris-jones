Abstract: Louise Pitre, its fearless and tireless star, may not have the piercingly clear pipes one usually associates with this role, but Pitre's more weathered sound (which you might recall from "Mamma Mia") unifies Mama Rose's numbers and the show's story of wearying persistence with uncommon intensity.

Full text: Â  "Blue Man Group" ****
In the latest version of the show at the Briar Street Theatre, a trio of "GiPads" descend from above, one per Blue Man. Open run at the Briar Street Theatre, 3133 N. Halsted St.; $49-$69 at ticketmaster.com
"Cabaret" ***
"Cabaret" stands myriad interpretations, especially in its two remarkable central characters, the amoral Emcee and Sally Bowles. Clearly, director David H. Bell has decided to make his leads tie more organically into a show that, ideally, is as much about the audience as the characters. Through Sunday at Marriott Theatre, 10 Marriott Drive, Lincolnshire; $40-$48 at 847-634-0200 and marriotttheatre.com
"Chicago's Golden Soul" ***
"Chicago's Golden Soul" is a straight-up musical revue, without the familiar biographical elements of the standard Jackie Taylor formula, but it was written and directed by an inveterate teacher. It's an elegiac celebration of the days when South Michigan Avenue was Record Row, and a direct-address lecture that comes with a little useful analysis of how the authenticity of Southern blues fused with the optimism of the Northern blues in this very town. But it's really all about the artists and their hits, including those re-created by Lawrence Williams, whose standout rendition of "Summertime" stops the show. Through March 30 at Black Ensemble Theatre, 4450 N. Clark St.; $55-$65 at 773-769-4451 or blackensembletheater.org
"A Clown Car Named Desire" ****
The revue "A Clown Car Named Desire" is one funny, high-stakes show, taking down the likes of Walgreens, Aldi and American Apparel. Open run at Second City e.t.c., 1608 N. Wells St.; $23-$28 at 312-337-3992 or secondcity.com
"Cock" ***
The historic backroom at 4139 N. Broadway has seen illicit activity in its day, but I doubt it has ever hosted cockfighting, at least not of the human kind imagined in Mike Bartlett's intense, arresting and intensely sexual play. The question of the night is whether or not a young man named John is gay. A subsidiary question is whether or not human sexuality should still be seen in binary terms. The sweet spot with this play involves making both of John's relationships with a man and a woman credible. Through May 25 at Profiles Theatre, 4139 N. Broadway St.; $35-$40 at 773-549-1815 and profilestheatre.org
"The Gospel of Lovingkindness" ***
Marcus Gardley's "The Gospel of Lovingkindness" is the latest in a series of gut-wrenching responses from Chicago's theaters to the scourge of gun violence in this city. In essence, the play follows parallel narrative tracks. One is the story of the kid who loses his life to violence; the other is the story of the shooter. The fusion of styles (and the use of just four actors to play all the characters) works well for much of this play, not the least because Gardley's language is so rich and resonant, and, frankly, the intensity of the consequences of such violence on this city's streets is best communicated with a sparse approach. While the ending has hope, it somehow does not ring entirely true in a play that is, up to that point, unstinting in the truth of its emotional undercurrent. Through March 30 at Victory Gardens Biograph Theater, 2433 N. Lincoln Ave.; $20-$60 at 773-871-3000 or victorygardens.org
"Gypsy" ****
Director Gary Griffin's emotional Chicago Shakespeare Theater revival of this iconic title is certainly the best "Gypsy" in Chicagoland for years. Louise Pitre, its fearless and tireless star, may not have the piercingly clear pipes one usually associates with this role, but Pitre's more weathered sound (which you might recall from "Mamma Mia") unifies Mama Rose's numbers and the show's story of wearying persistence with uncommon intensity. Through March 23 at Chicago Shakespeare Theater on Navy Pier, $48-$88 at 312-595-5600 or chicagoshakes.com
"Hedda Gabler" ****
Director Kimberly Senior's self-aware and thrillingly intimate new Writers Theatre production of the classic Henrik Ibsen portrait of the neurotic 19th-century married woman is a "Hedda Gabler" that knows it's a "Hedda Gabler," and knows you know too. OK, maybe Hedda was always just really bored with all the schlumpy Scandinavian men with whom she must share the frigid airspace. But here she seems well aware of how her story ends. . Through April 6 at Writers Theatre, 325 Tudor Court, Glencoe; $35-$70 at 847-242-6000 or writerstheatre.org
"The How and the Why" ****
Sarah Treem's beautifully toned, superbly acted and generally excellent two-character play begins with a clearly uncomfortable meeting between a young grad student and an older scientist. Her smart drama is very much about the legacy of the pioneering feminists in science, women who finally convinced men not only that topics like menstruation were worth studying but also that women scientists might have superior insights. Janet Ulrich Brooks' character is very much of that ilk. Elizabeth Ledo's character represents the younger generation, who must still fight against the sexism of the field but who arguably has more choices. Through April 6 at TimeLine Theatre Company, 615 W. Wellington Ave.; $35-$45 at 773-281-8463 or timelinetheatre.com
"The Language Archive" ***1/2
Imagine that if you were to leave your boyfriend, girlfriend, lover or spouse tonight, an entire language would die as you walked out the door. And here's another thought. Can words ever save a broken marriage? The idea that lovers and partners speak in their own language, one that can never be replicated by others, is one of the many fascinating ideas suffusing Julia Cho's very stimulating new play. This production is among the best work I've seen at Piven Theatre. Through March 23 at Piven Theatre Workshop, 927 Noyes St., Evanston; $20-$35 at 847-866-8049 or piventheatre.org
"The Little Prince" ***
"The Little Prince," the 1943 novella by French writer Antoine de Saint-Exupery -- one of the most beloved children's books -- has been adapted for the stage at Lookingglass Theatre. Director David Catlin's production is full of very creative ideas and the kind of circus-infused visuals for which Lookingglass is known. The show wants to embrace one of life's great paradoxes: our growing sense, as we get older, that children feel the world more clearly. Through Sunday at Lookingglass Theatre, 821 N. Michigan Ave.; $45-$75 at 312-337-0665 or lookingglasstheatre.org
"Million Dollar Quartet" ***1/2
One night in Memphis, Tenn., has turned into a long Chicago run for "Million Dollar Quartet." Open run at the Apollo Theater, 2540 N. Lincoln Ave.; $25-$85 at 773-935-6100 and apollochicago.com
"Rose and the Rime" ***
The House Theatre's "Rose and the Rime" is a likable, poignant, gently involving show, full of inventive physical staging. The plot involves the small town of Radio Falls, Mich., which has been beset by snow and ice following a witch's curse. A few whimsical songs aside, the show does not have the Broadway-quality score of "Frozen," but "Rose and the Rime" involves the audience explicitly in its storytelling. Through March 23 at the Chopin Theatre, 1543 W. Division St.; $20-$40 at thehousetheatre.com
"Seminar" ***1/2
If you have ever taken a writing workshop, Theresa Rebeck's ("Smash") slick and witheringly amusing "Seminar," staged by Haven Theatre, most certainly is a show for you. Her play follows a group of four aspiring New York fiction writers as they study with a perceived titan of the field who turns out to be a sexist, abusive, creepy curmudgeon -- and it clearly draws from Rebeck's myriad experiences on both sides of the lectern. Through April 13 at Theater Wit, 1229 W. Belmont Ave.; $32 at haventheatrechicago.com
HOTTEST TICKET
"Passion" ***
Stephen Sondheim and James Lapine's "Passion," set in 19th-century Italy, deals with a sickly woman named Fosca's obsessive love for the soldier Giorgio, even as that handsome dude carries on an affair with the very lovely, married Clara. Can Fosca reach him? You likely will be struck by how well this intimate theater serves this particular Stephen Sondheim-and-James Lapine title, which is an exceptionally challenging musical to stage in any size of theater. Theo Ubique mostly pulls it off. Mostly. Through April 27 at No Exit Cafe, 6970 N. Glenwood Ave.; $34-$64 at 800-595-4849 or theo-u.com/passion
