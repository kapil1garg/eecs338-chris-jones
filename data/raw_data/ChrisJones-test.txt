AFROCENTRISM STIRS DEBATE IN A BROOKLYN BEAUTY SALON

Author: Jones, Chris

Abstract: Winner of the 1994 Theodore Ward Playwriting Contest at Columbia College, "The Temple" is far from perfect, but [Charlotte] Gibson is a young playwright of considerable talent. And like so many of the new plays selected by the ETA Creative Arts Foundation, it uses an accessible experience from contemporary African-American life to draw its audience into a consideration of deeper cultural and political issues. Run by a young entrepreneur named Jasmine (Lisa Jeffrey), The Temple is a salon that specializes in braiding, a technique that not only requires the customer to sit for many hours but also is associated with an African--rather than a European--concept of beauty. Indeed, Jasmine's middle-aged assistant, Anile (Felisha McNeal), considers the salon to be a sacred spiritual center: "When you braid your hair," she says, "you're tickling your soul."

Full text: A Brooklyn beauty salon may seem like an unlikely dramatic metaphor for the debate over the merits of Afrocentrism versus economic opportunism, but Charlotte Gibson's funny and provocative new play aptly demonstrates the political potency of hair.
Winner of the 1994 Theodore Ward Playwriting Contest at Columbia College, "The Temple" is far from perfect, but Gibson is a young playwright of considerable talent. And like so many of the new plays selected by the ETA Creative Arts Foundation, it uses an accessible experience from contemporary African-American life to draw its audience into a consideration of deeper cultural and political issues.
Run by a young entrepreneur named Jasmine (Lisa Jeffrey), The Temple is a salon that specializes in braiding, a technique that not only requires the customer to sit for many hours but also is associated with an African--rather than a European--concept of beauty. Indeed, Jasmine's middle-aged assistant, Anile (Felisha McNeal), considers the salon to be a sacred spiritual center: "When you braid your hair," she says, "you're tickling your soul."
But this is an American Temple, and Jasmine also has to consider customers who want to look like Janet Jackson. When a rival salon starts poaching customers, she decides to turn The Temple into a full-service emporium and hires a new "regular" stylist (LaFern Watkins) trained in permanents by Sassoon.
That upsets the Jamaican braiders (Carol E. Hall and Jacqueline Fleming) and the all-natural haircare product supplier (TaRon Caveese Patton) and leads the women to question how they can reconcile their heritage with the pressures of the majority marketplace.
Seriously overwritten in places, "The Temple" often stretches its metaphors past the limits of believable conversation. But Gibson is a smooth writer with a sitcom-style ability to unleash a funny one-liner whenever the themes become overpowering. In fact, she's already working for ABC, and this well-structured play would make a great television pilot. Come to think of it, there's enough going on here for an entire season.
Chuck Smith's nicely visualized production could use a quicker pace (especially in the over-long second act), but it captures the humanistic spirit of the piece very well. Sporting impressive Island accents, Hall and Fleming are especially truthful and entertaining as the braiders, but then the whole ensemble of 11 women creates a salon-full of vivid and fascinating characters.
Among the design elements, Michael Alan Stein's beautifully eclectic costumes are especially impressive. They perfectly capture a group of strong, intelligent women struggling to marry sisterhood with professionalism.

SUBURBAN SUBVERSION JUDY TENUTA BRINGS HER BRAND OF HUMOR TO OAK BROOK

Abstract: Additional material published May 14, 1996: Corrections and clarifications. A May 5 review of comedian Judy Tenuta at Drury Lane Oakbrook Terrace contained an error. It was Ald. John Valle who booked the Tenuta show and joined the comedian on stage, not Oakbrook Terrace's director of tourism, who had no connection with the show and was on vacation at the time. The Tribune regrets the error. A one-woman force of suburban subversion, Judy Tenuta turned Friday night at the chandelier-clad Drury Lane, Oak Brook, into a homecoming bacchanal. And she made the western suburbs look more like the Roman Empire--just before it fell flat on its face. Confused local pizza-delivery guys found themselves delivering hot slices directly to the mouth of the self-styled love-goddess on stage. The director of tourism for Oakbrook Terrace--the hapless soul who booked this outrageous comedian--ended up prostrate on stage, the object of a fertility dance. A very elderly couple-who didn't even know who they were watching-were obliged to perform a polka to a disco beat.

Full text: Additional material published May 14, 1996: Corrections and clarifications. A May 5 review of comedian Judy Tenuta at Drury Lane Oakbrook Terrace contained an error. It was Ald. John Valle who booked the Tenuta show and joined the comedian on stage, not Oakbrook Terrace's director of tourism, who had no connection with the show and was on vacation at the time. The Tribune regrets the error.
A one-woman force of suburban subversion, Judy Tenuta turned Friday night at the chandelier-clad Drury Lane, Oak Brook, into a homecoming bacchanal. And she made the western suburbs look more like the Roman Empire--just before it fell flat on its face.
Confused local pizza-delivery guys found themselves delivering hot slices directly to the mouth of the self-styled love-goddess on stage. The director of tourism for Oakbrook Terrace--the hapless soul who booked this outrageous comedian--ended up prostrate on stage, the object of a fertility dance. A very elderly couple-who didn't even know who they were watching-were obliged to perform a polka to a disco beat.
Even Tenuta's poor mother was dragged from her seat and forced to feed pickled wieners to a "stud puppet" who had come to the show bearing canned goods.
It was all in a night's work for the "petite duchess of discipline." And her loud and brazen devotees loved every minute.
Raised a few miles east in Oak Park but now living in California, Tenuta was clearly relishing being back on familiar turf. She knew she was home, she said, when O'Hare International Airport smelled just like pizza.
Along for the ride was her brother, Jim. Looking rather like an aging Chippendale's dancer, this strange fellow punctuated his sister's monologues with silly dances and revealing costumes.
Over the course of a 90-minute X-rated routine, the alternately coquettish and viscous Tenuta ripped into suburbia, lampooning the virgins of Villa Park; the bowlers of Berwyn; the airheads of Addison. By the end of the show, she had somehow persuaded two large and seemingly conservative suburban gentlemen to engage in a peculiar and obscene dance with clown wigs, a set of fake breasts and a large inflatable phallus. One could only guess at their motivation.
The mainstay of Tenuta's act, of course, is the lampooning of authority figures. She described a policeman as a "lava lamp in a leisure suit," and ridiculed both the pope and the president (she transformed the Oval Office into the Ovular Office). Particular venom is reserved, though, for the pretentious icons of the middle class; Tenuta dismisses the likes of Kathie Lee Gifford, Dr. Ruth Westheimer and Cher with a few, choice, acidic words.
For all her outrageous antics, though, this curious woman remains an intensely likable performer. Part of her appeal is her delicious sense of the absurd. She will let loose an obscenity, and then flit around the stage in a mockery of feminine innocence. She'll belt out her punch line and then scrunch up her face and screech "'He-llo" with a slowness that drips with sarcasm.
Some fans of early, more politicized Tenuta may see this newer, flashier act as closer to Las Vegas than a night at the improv. A small portion of her material was recycled from her album, "Buy This Pigs!"
But Tenuta has a remarkable ability to couple adult standup comedy with the warmth of a committed vaudevillian. Her deconstructive humor is ultimately a freeing comedy of empowerment. Even the collar counties sometimes like to unbutton.
