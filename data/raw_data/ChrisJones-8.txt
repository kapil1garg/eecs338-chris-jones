AFROCENTRISM STIRS DEBATE IN A BROOKLYN BEAUTY SALON

Author: Jones, Chris

Abstract: Winner of the 1994 Theodore Ward Playwriting Contest at Columbia College, "The Temple" is far from perfect, but [Charlotte] Gibson is a young playwright of considerable talent. And like so many of the new plays selected by the ETA Creative Arts Foundation, it uses an accessible experience from contemporary African-American life to draw its audience into a consideration of deeper cultural and political issues. Run by a young entrepreneur named Jasmine (Lisa Jeffrey), The Temple is a salon that specializes in braiding, a technique that not only requires the customer to sit for many hours but also is associated with an African--rather than a European--concept of beauty. Indeed, Jasmine's middle-aged assistant, Anile (Felisha McNeal), considers the salon to be a sacred spiritual center: "When you braid your hair," she says, "you're tickling your soul."

Full text: A Brooklyn beauty salon may seem like an unlikely dramatic metaphor for the debate over the merits of Afrocentrism versus economic opportunism, but Charlotte Gibson's funny and provocative new play aptly demonstrates the political potency of hair.
Winner of the 1994 Theodore Ward Playwriting Contest at Columbia College, "The Temple" is far from perfect, but Gibson is a young playwright of considerable talent. And like so many of the new plays selected by the ETA Creative Arts Foundation, it uses an accessible experience from contemporary African-American life to draw its audience into a consideration of deeper cultural and political issues.
Run by a young entrepreneur named Jasmine (Lisa Jeffrey), The Temple is a salon that specializes in braiding, a technique that not only requires the customer to sit for many hours but also is associated with an African--rather than a European--concept of beauty. Indeed, Jasmine's middle-aged assistant, Anile (Felisha McNeal), considers the salon to be a sacred spiritual center: "When you braid your hair," she says, "you're tickling your soul."
But this is an American Temple, and Jasmine also has to consider customers who want to look like Janet Jackson. When a rival salon starts poaching customers, she decides to turn The Temple into a full-service emporium and hires a new "regular" stylist (LaFern Watkins) trained in permanents by Sassoon.
That upsets the Jamaican braiders (Carol E. Hall and Jacqueline Fleming) and the all-natural haircare product supplier (TaRon Caveese Patton) and leads the women to question how they can reconcile their heritage with the pressures of the majority marketplace.
Seriously overwritten in places, "The Temple" often stretches its metaphors past the limits of believable conversation. But Gibson is a smooth writer with a sitcom-style ability to unleash a funny one-liner whenever the themes become overpowering. In fact, she's already working for ABC, and this well-structured play would make a great television pilot. Come to think of it, there's enough going on here for an entire season.
Chuck Smith's nicely visualized production could use a quicker pace (especially in the over-long second act), but it captures the humanistic spirit of the piece very well. Sporting impressive Island accents, Hall and Fleming are especially truthful and entertaining as the braiders, but then the whole ensemble of 11 women creates a salon-full of vivid and fascinating characters.
Among the design elements, Michael Alan Stein's beautifully eclectic costumes are especially impressive. They perfectly capture a group of strong, intelligent women struggling to marry sisterhood with professionalism.

SUBURBAN SUBVERSION JUDY TENUTA BRINGS HER BRAND OF HUMOR TO OAK BROOK

Author: Chris Jones. Special to the Tribune.

Abstract: Additional material published May 14, 1996: Corrections and clarifications. A May 5 review of comedian Judy Tenuta at Drury Lane Oakbrook Terrace contained an error. It was Ald. John Valle who booked the Tenuta show and joined the comedian on stage, not Oakbrook Terrace's director of tourism, who had no connection with the show and was on vacation at the time. The Tribune regrets the error. A one-woman force of suburban subversion, Judy Tenuta turned Friday night at the chandelier-clad Drury Lane, Oak Brook, into a homecoming bacchanal. And she made the western suburbs look more like the Roman Empire--just before it fell flat on its face. Confused local pizza-delivery guys found themselves delivering hot slices directly to the mouth of the self-styled love-goddess on stage. The director of tourism for Oakbrook Terrace--the hapless soul who booked this outrageous comedian--ended up prostrate on stage, the object of a fertility dance. A very elderly couple-who didn't even know who they were watching-were obliged to perform a polka to a disco beat.

Full text: Additional material published May 14, 1996: Corrections and clarifications. A May 5 review of comedian Judy Tenuta at Drury Lane Oakbrook Terrace contained an error. It was Ald. John Valle who booked the Tenuta show and joined the comedian on stage, not Oakbrook Terrace's director of tourism, who had no connection with the show and was on vacation at the time. The Tribune regrets the error.
A one-woman force of suburban subversion, Judy Tenuta turned Friday night at the chandelier-clad Drury Lane, Oak Brook, into a homecoming bacchanal. And she made the western suburbs look more like the Roman Empire--just before it fell flat on its face.
Confused local pizza-delivery guys found themselves delivering hot slices directly to the mouth of the self-styled love-goddess on stage. The director of tourism for Oakbrook Terrace--the hapless soul who booked this outrageous comedian--ended up prostrate on stage, the object of a fertility dance. A very elderly couple-who didn't even know who they were watching-were obliged to perform a polka to a disco beat.
Even Tenuta's poor mother was dragged from her seat and forced to feed pickled wieners to a "stud puppet" who had come to the show bearing canned goods.
It was all in a night's work for the "petite duchess of discipline." And her loud and brazen devotees loved every minute.
Raised a few miles east in Oak Park but now living in California, Tenuta was clearly relishing being back on familiar turf. She knew she was home, she said, when O'Hare International Airport smelled just like pizza.
Along for the ride was her brother, Jim. Looking rather like an aging Chippendale's dancer, this strange fellow punctuated his sister's monologues with silly dances and revealing costumes.
Over the course of a 90-minute X-rated routine, the alternately coquettish and viscous Tenuta ripped into suburbia, lampooning the virgins of Villa Park; the bowlers of Berwyn; the airheads of Addison. By the end of the show, she had somehow persuaded two large and seemingly conservative suburban gentlemen to engage in a peculiar and obscene dance with clown wigs, a set of fake breasts and a large inflatable phallus. One could only guess at their motivation.
The mainstay of Tenuta's act, of course, is the lampooning of authority figures. She described a policeman as a "lava lamp in a leisure suit," and ridiculed both the pope and the president (she transformed the Oval Office into the Ovular Office). Particular venom is reserved, though, for the pretentious icons of the middle class; Tenuta dismisses the likes of Kathie Lee Gifford, Dr. Ruth Westheimer and Cher with a few, choice, acidic words.
For all her outrageous antics, though, this curious woman remains an intensely likable performer. Part of her appeal is her delicious sense of the absurd. She will let loose an obscenity, and then flit around the stage in a mockery of feminine innocence. She'll belt out her punch line and then scrunch up her face and screech "'He-llo" with a slowness that drips with sarcasm.
Some fans of early, more politicized Tenuta may see this newer, flashier act as closer to Las Vegas than a night at the improv. A small portion of her material was recycled from her album, "Buy This Pigs!"
But Tenuta has a remarkable ability to couple adult standup comedy with the warmth of a committed vaudevillian. Her deconstructive humor is ultimately a freeing comedy of empowerment. Even the collar counties sometimes like to unbutton.

STYLE OVERWHELMS BLACK PANTHERS' STORY

Author: Chris Jones. Special to the Tribune.

http://turing.library.northwestern.edu/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/291146057?accountid=12861

Abstract: Anyone forced to stare down the barrels of several realistic guns currently being pointed directly in spectators' faces at the National Pastime Theatre quickly gains an understanding of why mainstream America was once so intimidated by the Black Panthers. Frank Pullen's production of Robert Alexander's "Servant of the People! The Rise and Fall of Huey P. Newton and the Black Panther Party" is a lively--and often intimidating--evening of confrontational theater. The ambitious National Pastime's cauldron-like space is perfect for enveloping an audience in a 1960s urban war zone, especially when leather-jacketed men with guns guard the doors to Broadway.

Full text: Anyone forced to stare down the barrels of several realistic guns currently being pointed directly in spectators' faces at the National Pastime Theatre quickly gains an understanding of why mainstream America was once so intimidated by the Black Panthers.
Frank Pullen's production of Robert Alexander's "Servant of the People! The Rise and Fall of Huey P. Newton and the Black Panther Party" is a lively--and often intimidating--evening of confrontational theater. The ambitious National Pastime's cauldron-like space is perfect for enveloping an audience in a 1960s urban war zone, especially when leather-jacketed men with guns guard the doors to Broadway.
Both script and director make liberal use of other Brechtian techniques--including narration, a non-linear structure, projected titles and direct address. A clever multilevel setting from Jack Phend and remarkable graffiti art by Dzine combine for a provocative environment.
But style ultimately overwhelms substance, and the flashy visuals don't compensate for uneven acting and an inconsistent play. All of the slick staging and self-referential dramaturgy cannot cover some humanistic cracks: we gain insufficient insight into the period and the man under exploration.
Commissioned by the Oakland Ensemble Theatre in the city that gave birth to the Panthers, Alexander's episodic play garnered national attention in 1995, when it premiered simultaneously in St. Louis and Atlanta. It's a natural fit for Chicago, given this city's links to the party: Bobby Seale, Bobby Rush, Fred Hampton.
The main focus of Alexander's essentially personal play, though, is Newton (Jonathan Bradley Wafer). The piece suggests that Newton was a flawed--even ultimately tragic--hero whose genuine desire to do good social works was undermined by a racist FBI and the gun-toting street gangsters he chose for company.
Along with the police, the power-hungry Eldridge Cleaver (J. Richard Tipper) is the villain of Alexander's revisionist piece, depicted as undermining Newton's control and pushing decent social progressives like Seale (Samuel Jordan) out of the movement.
Wafer's performance is solid but he struggles to bring alive Newton's remarkable speeches. The impressive Tipper is much better cast, but Jordan also seems uneasy with his key role as Panther co-founder Seale.
There are so many vital issues swirling around this play--the use of armed struggle in social progress, the contradictory identity of the Panthers, the racism of the authorities and the suspiciously ignoble death of Newton--that one craves a fuller exploration. Fleeting images cannot tell the Black Panthers' whole story.

`THE TRIPS' TAKES US FOR QUITE A RIDE

Abstract: Jenny Magnus and Beau O'Reilly have taken a long, rough trip before arriving at the Steppenwolf. These fixtures of Chicago's low-budget performance circuit have worked in countless tiny venues--garages, basements, restaurants. Penned by Magnus, "The Trips: A Madras Parable" was seen earlier this year at Links Hall and the Rhino Festival. Magnus and O'Reilly now find themselves working late nights on Halsted, right in the middle of the setting for "The Cryptogram."

Full text: Jenny Magnus and Beau O'Reilly have taken a long, rough trip before arriving at the Steppenwolf.
These fixtures of Chicago's low-budget performance circuit have worked in countless tiny venues--garages, basements, restaurants. Penned by Magnus, "The Trips: A Madras Parable" was seen earlier this year at Links Hall and the Rhino Festival. Magnus and O'Reilly now find themselves working late nights on Halsted, right in the middle of the setting for "The Cryptogram."
Using just two chairs and a couple of music stands, Magnus and O'Reilly forge an imaginative world with room only for two actors. They could be working on the street, and the audience would still be transfixed.
"The Trips" presents a car journey as a metaphor for a personal relationship. Over the course of 50 minutes, Magnus and O'Reilly go for a ride. They encounter rough ground, unexpected bumps and a devastating crash. They fight over the choice of radio stations, the best route, who drives, and slowly drive each other nuts.
Sharing themes with absurdist playwrights, "The Trips" (also the last name of the characters) has a circular rather than a linear narrative and is preoccupied with existential questions. But though it's not for late-night relaxation, it is very funny. Massaging phrases with delicious relish, one minute the characters are screaming at each other, the next they are harmonizing on "Proud Mary."
The rumpled O'Reilly is a cross between Steven Berkoff and Bert Lahr. The poker-faced Magnus is quicker and peppier. The two styles contrast so well you'd think you were watching the Delany Sisters in "Having Our Say."

`CANUS' WRITER IS BARKING UP THE WRONG TREE

Author: Chris Jones. Special to the Tribune.

http://turing.library.northwestern.edu/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/291133085?accountid=12861

Abstract: Like "Reservoir Dogs" or "Pulp Fiction," [Chris] Stolte's "Canus Lunis Balloonis" has a quixotic narrative, a macho sensibility, bloody violence mixed with comedy, and a penchant for breaking dramatic rules. What the slick-but-messy play lacks, though, is anything worthwhile to say about the human condition. The setting of Stolte's ensemble-driven play is Chicago's Northwest Side, where a group of 30ish males gather at the house of a lawyer named Max (Guy Van Swearingen) to play poker and drink beer. They're a strange bunch of losers. Stolte plays Colin, a rough-hewn divorcee worried about collecting a bet from bookmaker Jake (Keith Kupferer). There's a sensitive musician named Michael (Kurt Brocker), and an odd man called Stewie (Mike Shannon), whom everyone hates.

Full text: Chris Stolte's frustrating new drama is a fine example of the pervasive influence of cinematic style in general--and Quentin Tarantino's work in particular--on today's young playwrights.

The setting of Stolte's ensemble-driven play is Chicago's Northwest Side, where a group of 30ish males gather at the house of a lawyer named Max (Guy Van Swearingen) to play poker and drink beer. They're a strange bunch of losers. Stolte plays Colin, a rough-hewn divorcee worried about collecting a bet from bookmaker Jake (Keith Kupferer). There's a sensitive musician named Michael (Kurt Brocker), and an odd man called Stewie (Mike Shannon), whom everyone hates.
The Latin title of the play refers to Max's offstage dog, who continually howls at a balloon stuck on a power line, thinking it's a full moon. That heavy-handed symbol has little obvious connection with the events onstage.
Over the course of the two-hour play, pseudo-realistic male bonding deteriorates into warfare. In the second act, Stolte takes a number of David Lynch-like surreal excursions into his characters' nightmares, changing the play's internal logic so often that one stops caring about these nihilistic fellows.
Stolte has some talent as a writer. He knows how to make interesting linguistic connections (one character goes from "dog bites" to "Richard Dreyfuss" within half a line) and constructs funny non sequiturs. But the rambling "Canus Lunis Balloonis" is seriously out of control.
The same can be said for Rich Cotovsky's production, even though it benefits from competent acting. There are times when the energetic performers connect powerfully (Shannon and Van Swearingen are especially good), but the second act is loose and uncertain.
The most successful elements of the evening are the design elements--Robert G. Smith's realistic but off-kilter kitchen is a marvelous piece of work and there's an imaginative and complex sound design from Joe Fosco.

A LITTLE OFF-KEY `SUICIDE IN B-FLAT' LACKS HONESTY, ARTISTS' PASSION

Author: Chris Jones. Special to the Tribune.

http://turing.library.northwestern.edu/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/291147218?accountid=12861

Abstract: A few years before Sam Shepard wrote his one-act "Suicide in B-Flat" in 1976, he told an interviewer that he would rather have been a musician than a playwright. In actuality, the maverick American scribe often combined the two professions on the page. Like "Angel City" and "The Tooth of Crime," Shepard's early "Suicide" is not only a drama about dysfunctional musicians, but a series of instrumental riffs.

Full text: A few years before Sam Shepard wrote his one-act "Suicide in B-Flat" in 1976, he told an interviewer that he would rather have been a musician than a playwright. In actuality, the maverick American scribe often combined the two professions on the page. Like "Angel City" and "The Tooth of Crime," Shepard's early "Suicide" is not only a drama about dysfunctional musicians, but a series of instrumental riffs.
The plot revolves around a couple of B-movie detectives (played by Kevin Mullaney and Michael Carroll) investigating the apparent suicide of Niles (Robert Maffia), an improvisational jazz pianist who became despondent after nobody paid to hear his work. The initially naive gumshoes are quickly trapped in a supernatural nightmare. Two of the dead player's longtime collaborators (Bret Grafton and Robin Witt) interrupt the investigation with music. Finally the "victim" himself shows up, accompanied by a kittenish girlfriend (Ann Noble), but the hapless investigators cannot see him.
As the strange action of the drama unwinds with live piano accompaniment (sensually performed by Gerald H. Bailey), it quickly becomes obvious that narrative twists are not the main focus here--"Suicide in B-Flat" is a musical meditation on the role of an artist that just happens to be a play.
One can see why Center Theater Ensemble's perceptive artistic director Dan LaMorte was attracted to a revival of this still-potent 20-year-old play. Given the often diminutive audiences at some off-Loop theaters, Shepard's youthful musings about lonely and subversive artists' troubled relationships with their unappreciative public still have considerable resonance. This revival could appropriately have been set in Wicker Park.
But while it features some interesting visual images, an appropriately intense performance from lead Maffia, and a nicely expressionistic setting from Joseph Wade, LaMorte's competent but cold production seemed uneasy on opening night.
Several performers were unsure of their rhythms, and the dialogue tended to fight the piano music rather than complementing its nuances. With earnest but clean-cut actors appearing overly removed from their seedy characters' improvised desperation, the production lacked honesty and most of the dark comic business fell flat.
In short, the passion of the artist was missing. And thus the show never reached the kind of lyrical sensuality that could match the heat of the night outside.

`PHANTOM' LIVES ON IT'S MILWAUKEE'S TURN TO BE THRILLED BY THE MUSIC OF THE NIGHT

Author: Chris Jones. Special to the Tribune.

http://turing.library.northwestern.edu/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/291151772?accountid=12861

Abstract: It is now nearly 10 years since Andrew Lloyd Webber's "The Phantom of the Opera" began haunting London. And even though initial reviews were mixed, the masked warbler has (virtually single-handedly) rejuvenated touring Broadway. Love it or hate it, there's no denying that "Phantom" is the most popular theatrical production in the world. Thus even though some of the cast of the third national company of "Phantom" (which is summering at the Milwaukee Performing Arts Center) were in middle school when Michael Crawford first essayed the role of the tortured occupant of the Paris Opera, Wisconsin theatergoers are seeing--and embracing--a proven show that's as close as humanly possible to every other Lloyd Webber "Phantom."

Full text: It is now nearly 10 years since Andrew Lloyd Webber's "The Phantom of the Opera" began haunting London. And even though initial reviews were mixed, the masked warbler has (virtually single-handedly) rejuvenated touring Broadway. Love it or hate it, there's no denying that "Phantom" is the most popular theatrical production in the world.
The secret behind this blockbuster was learned long ago by businesses like McDonald's. If you give the public a consistent and familiar product of good quality, you can keep building new outlets and expanding into smaller and smaller markets.
Thus even though some of the cast of the third national company of "Phantom" (which is summering at the Milwaukee Performing Arts Center) were in middle school when Michael Crawford first essayed the role of the tortured occupant of the Paris Opera, Wisconsin theatergoers are seeing--and embracing--a proven show that's as close as humanly possible to every other Lloyd Webber "Phantom."
The orchestra is full size. The spectacular built-to-travel setting seems identical to the huge rig that once occupied the Auditorium Theatre. The (type) cast hits its marks with the consistency of a mechanical chandelier. And the audience rises to its feet at exactly the same spot as they do throughout the developed world--when that scary-but-vulnerable ghoul makes his final entrance.
Performers are not burgers, of course, regardless of the mixing and matching of actors as if they were highly paid cattle--little slips of paper indicating the cast changes du jour fall from the program like confetti. Multiple Christines have visited Wisconsin, playing the ingenue originated by Sarah Brightman. Last weekend, the sweet-voiced but physically uneasy Susan Facer was torn between two potential lovers; other performances have been sung by Diane Fratantoni. This week, an entirely new actress (Adrienne McEwan) has the role. It matters little. Even though there is only one regular Raul on this tour, ex-Chicagoan John Schroeder, he's a cookie-cutter leading man.
The main distinction between companies lies with the lead. Compared with four others, Thomas James O'Leary is an excellent "Phantom." While he could not be accused of underplaying, the vocally exciting O'Leary has an extraordinary falsetto and understands the need to be as seductive as he is tortured. The one other standout in this cast is Julie Schmidt, who plays Carlotta, the diva: Schmidt sings so well one wishes Christine did not keep winning all her roles.
But Harold Prince's exciting production is otherwise in fine shape. An easy drive from Chicagoland, Milwaukee offers this epic spectacle in a relatively intimate theater. More than 90 percent of the seats are already sold.

`LOVES LIGHT' STILL A CROWD-PLEASER

Author: Chris Jones. Special to the Tribune.

http://turing.library.northwestern.edu/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/291162633?accountid=12861

Abstract: More than 90 percent of the productions at the ETA Creative Arts Foundation are world premieres of new African-American plays. So if this ambitious South Side company decides to bring back a show its savvy audience has seen before, you can be sure the piece in question is a real crowd-pleaser. "Loves Light in Flight," an exceptionally funny comedy of contemporary manners by local playwright Charles Michael Moore, certainly fits that description. This raucous tale of modern love and life is one of ETA's biggest success stories. Since its 1987 ETA premiere, Moore's farcical play has been seen in both Indianapolis and Los Angeles and was recently published in Woodie King Jr.'s "National Black Drama Anthology." For this current revival, Moore ably directs his own work.

Full text: More than 90 percent of the productions at the ETA Creative Arts Foundation are world premieres of new African-American plays. So if this ambitious South Side company decides to bring back a show its savvy audience has seen before, you can be sure the piece in question is a real crowd-pleaser.
"Loves Light in Flight," an exceptionally funny comedy of contemporary manners by local playwright Charles Michael Moore, certainly fits that description. This raucous tale of modern love and life is one of ETA's biggest success stories. Since its 1987 ETA premiere, Moore's farcical play has been seen in both Indianapolis and Los Angeles and was recently published in Woodie King Jr.'s "National Black Drama Anthology." For this current revival, Moore ably directs his own work.
It is easy to understand why theaters have been clamoring to produce this highly commercial show, even though its traditional domestic dramaturgy pushes few theatrical boundaries. Moore manages to explore interesting human questions while simultaneously entertaining his audience with scenes of ripe sexual farce that are reminiscent of Ray Cooney at his best.
Set in a small Michigan town, the play follows the homecoming of Halsted Bridges (Paul Hobbs). Running away from both a claustrophobic relationship and the loss of a job in Cleveland, the lead character moves in with his exuberant sister, Burnetta (Martrice Edge), and her buffoonish husband, Leonard (Ron Pearson).
For fun, auto mechanic Halsted hangs with his old buddy, Earl (Woody Bolar), who maintains a hip pad and numerous simultaneous relationships. Before long, Halsted finds himself romantically involved with his seductive boss, Venus (Tyla). That sits badly with her bad-tempered husband, Arthur (Darren Jones). Then Halsted's old flame (TaRon Patton) shows up and . . . well . . . things get complicated.
There are important themes among the merriment--Moore explores the search for love and personal identity amidst the economic, racial and marital problems of the rust belt. But the main appeal of this show lies with its rich galaxy of eccentric characters, all deftly impersonated by an ensemble of uniformly fine farceurs--especially the manic Edge and Bolar, who are both side-splittingly funny.
"Loves Light" approaches the lines of good taste at times--it's hard to make merriment from misfired guns and domestic violence, however cartoonishly presented. But this is an entertaining and honest show that laughs at life and relationships just the way the artists find them.

FINE `BETRAYAL' AVOIDS COMMON PITFALLS

Author: Chris Jones. Special to the Tribune.

http://turing.library.northwestern.edu/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/291146030?accountid=12861

Abstract: If that were not challenge enough, [Harold] Pinter reverses chronology as he paints the events that lead to the breakdown of an extra-marital love affair between Emma (Colleen McLaughlin) and Jerry (Michael Loeffelholz), taking place around the unspoken animosity of Emma's husband (and Jerry's best friend), Robert (Jeffrey Griggs). The evening begins as love ends, and the final scene takes place three years earlier when a drunken grope starts a long affair. This being Pinter, none of the backwards-moving scenes connect explicitly with one another, or explain the rise and fall of passion. Life remains mysterious--its links tenuous, its relationships consistently inexplicable.

Full text: An actors' symphony of subtext and suspicion, Harold Pinter's "Betrayal" is harder to produce than its deceptively simple structure suggests.
In classic Pinter (and British) fashion, none of the characters in this love triangle ever say what they are really feeling. Lust, venom and vulnerabilities merely simmer under the surface as the professionals in this hidden drama pour themselves another drink.
If that were not challenge enough, Pinter reverses chronology as he paints the events that lead to the breakdown of an extra-marital love affair between Emma (Colleen McLaughlin) and Jerry (Michael Loeffelholz), taking place around the unspoken animosity of Emma's husband (and Jerry's best friend), Robert (Jeffrey Griggs). The evening begins as love ends, and the final scene takes place three years earlier when a drunken grope starts a long affair. This being Pinter, none of the backwards-moving scenes connect explicitly with one another, or explain the rise and fall of passion. Life remains mysterious--its links tenuous, its relationships consistently inexplicable.
Seeing love move in reverse, of course, is revelatory. And this revival at the rented American Blues space by the Non-Prophet Theatre Company confirms the ongoing power of this fine 1980 play, even if some of its cultural references (to old-fashioned payphones, for example) are becoming dated.
Non-Prophet has links to Lincoln College in central Illinois: The director, Jerry Dellinger, is on the faculty; the three principal actors are all former students. By reviving the oft-presented "Betrayal," all invite comparison with a memorable film and several prior Chicago productions.
The actors here are too young and too inexperienced to mine the full depths of this profound play. But they have enough strong moments to make their work enjoyable. When he isn't stymied by an overblown English accent, Griggs potently captures the latent nastiness of a jilted husband. Loeffelholz overdoes the stammering confusion, but his Jerry is perversely empathetic. The impressive McLaughlin is the best of the three: alternately vulnerable and vacuous, she finds a lot between her lines.
Some productions of "Betrayal" overdo Pinter's trademark menace, turning conversation into battle. The other extreme is flat naturalism, leading to boredom. Dellinger's thoughtful (if conservative) direction avoids both traps. Aside from cumbersome set changes that needlessly re-arrange a dull setting, this is a solid production of one of Pinter's best works.

LIVELY RHINOCEROS FEST IS WORTH THE LONG TRIP

http://turing.library.northwestern.edu/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/291154116?accountid=12861

Abstract: Before the end of the opening of the Rhino Fest, most of the audience had gone home and organizer Beau O'Reilly looked like he might fall asleep on top of his light board. But that's all part of the aesthetic of this five-week rotating extravaganza of local performers presenting new work--often on triple bills. The talented Julie Lafin's trademark human installations feature her ongoing travails with a series of huge designer gowns which flow from her body and engulf her entire environment. For her latest provocative and striking piece, "Over," Lafin spends five hours prone on the Lincoln Avenue sidewalk surrounded by a tiny tape player playing an existential monologue, while her huge floodlit red dress formed an interactive entrance canopy to the Cabaret.

For her latest provocative and striking piece, "Over," Lafin spends five hours prone on the Lincoln Avenue sidewalk surrounded by a tiny tape player playing an existential monologue, while her huge floodlit red dress formed an interactive entrance canopy to the Cabaret.
Theatre Oobleck's Danny Thompson simultaneously re-creates the history of the theater by manipulating a series of puppets made from various found objects.
Clad in an ugly yellow T-shirt, the bearded, spluttering Thompson is the antithesis of polished performance--he loses props in the middle of his show and forgets his place in the script. But he's smart and mercilessly funny. Rattling through centuries of theater in an hour (doing all the voices), he rolls out one sight gag after another.
Eugene O'Neill is represented by a bottle of booze; a row of audience members by eggs in a box; Andrew Lloyd Webber by a head of lettuce. Even Frank Galati makes an appearance--as a jar of glue with an attached pair of scissors. Thompson's closing rant goes on too long, but the rest of this one-man satire is poor theater at its least pretentious.
Although unnecessarily tense, Dave Kodeski delivers a delicately and lovingly written piece of original oral history chronicling the life of a fascinating 93-year-old former social worker and minister's wife who lives in a Chicago retirement home. Ordinary people like "Doris," Kodeski wisely observes, often have extraordinary lives.
Four-and-a-half hours of opening-night performance ended with Larry Jones barking the amplified words of Nelson Algren to the postmodern musical accompaniment of stellar East German double-bassist Aki Schulz. In "Chicago: City on the Make," Algren emphasizes the duality of this town--a monument to "man's endless war against himself," a place you love "knowing it can never love you back." Jones' raging style is perfect for Algren's wise brand of vigorous cynicism, but he forgets that less is more when it's pushing midnight.

HENDERSON MAKES `WIND' WORK

Author: Chris Jones. Special to the Tribune.

http://turing.library.northwestern.edu/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/291160944?accountid=12861

Abstract: "Big Wind on Campus" is [Gregory] Henderson's contribution to the growing genre of the character-based one-person show, in which an actor impersonates a parade of eccentric people, linked by location, situation or family. Although these shows often claim to be making universal statements about the human condition, the characters in these idiosyncratic affairs are generally all reflections of different sides of their creators. Thus Danny Hoch's people have a hard urban edge. Sherry Glaser chronicles a warm Jewish family. And young Henderson delivers college-town characters seen through the creator's openly gay prism.

Full text: At the end of his charming one-person show, Gregory Henderson delivers a Carol Channing-style curtain speech in rhyming couplets, effusively thanking the audience and remarking how much Chicago reminds him of his native Oklahoma. From the mouth of others, the epilogue would seem twee and disingenuous. But the guileless Henderson somehow pulls it off, because this young performer is so earnest, genuine and talented.
"Big Wind on Campus" is Henderson's contribution to the growing genre of the character-based one-person show, in which an actor impersonates a parade of eccentric people, linked by location, situation or family. Although these shows often claim to be making universal statements about the human condition, the characters in these idiosyncratic affairs are generally all reflections of different sides of their creators. Thus Danny Hoch's people have a hard urban edge. Sherry Glaser chronicles a warm Jewish family. And young Henderson delivers college-town characters seen through the creator's openly gay prism.
The setting of "Big Wind" is a fictional Southern campus and the dramatic linking device is an impending tornado. Starting out as a peppy co-ed named Bitsy, Henderson plays an old campus groundsman and a collegiate cowboy named Bubba (Bitsy's boyfriend). Then there's a fundamentalist Christian drummer, a counter-cultural young student, Bitsy's flaky mother Peggy Lou, and a flamboyant drum major called Steve.
Performing for two hours, Henderson wears out his welcome and his decision to reprise his least effective character in the second act is poor. There's always a danger (especially in urbane Chicago) that unsophisticated comic southerners will come across as derogatory stereotypes. A better performer than writer, Henderson walks a fine line here, but this strong and funny actor's genuine affection for the characters' troubles seems so born of personal experience that the show has uncommon warmth. Equally at home in a cowboy hat or a dress, Henderson's carefully choreographed transitions are entertaining and the show is tightly directed by Joseph Massa. Hopefully we'll be hearing more from Henderson as he matures--his heart is definitely in the right place.

THE IMAGE IS THE THING NON-PROFIT THEATERS HAVE LEARNED A LESSON FROM COMMERCIAL PRODUCERS: YOU GOTTA HAVE ART ...AND A LOGO

Abstract: The waif who hawks "Les Miserables" in countless advertisements is a highly adaptable young woman. As the endlessly touring musical has trekked across America through a decade of seasons, that vulnerable creature has been seen wearing Santa's hat, sporting a pair of cool shades, even carving a turkey. Through all her travails--her spotless image is ever changing but always recognizable--for millions of theatergoers, she is "Les Mis." Just as corporate America pins its profits on images such as golden arches and an apple minus a bite, so the touring megamusicals of the 1990s have learned that a logo can help them sell out. The carefully honed images of these shows are instantly recognizable. "Sunset Boulevard" uses a simple but evocative street sign. "Miss Saigon" draws a helicopter in Asian script. Now and forever, "Cats" purrs from the page with a pair of leering feline eyes. "The Phantom of the Opera" haunts with its celebrated half-mask. When "A Clockwork Orange" played at the Steppenwolf Theatre two years ago, it seemed that the logo for the show--a bald man's head with a workman drilling into the skull against a cloud-filled sky--was popping up everywhere. It was the work of Bo Bartlett, a Philadelphia-based painter who has designed images for every subsequent Steppenwolf show. The other big non-profit in town, the Goodman Theatre, also recently made a commitment to work with the same graphic designer for every play in its upcoming season--in this case, Tom Herzberg, a Chicago artist best known for his editorial illustration work in local newspapers and magazines.

Full text: The waif who hawks "Les Miserables" in countless advertisements is a highly adaptable young woman. As the endlessly touring musical has trekked across America through a decade of seasons, that vulnerable creature has been seen wearing Santa's hat, sporting a pair of cool shades, even carving a turkey. Through all her travails--her spotless image is ever changing but always recognizable--for millions of theatergoers, she is "Les Mis."
Just as corporate America pins its profits on images such as golden arches and an apple minus a bite, so the touring megamusicals of the 1990s have learned that a logo can help them sell out. The carefully honed images of these shows are instantly recognizable. "Sunset Boulevard" uses a simple but evocative street sign. "Miss Saigon" draws a helicopter in Asian script. Now and forever, "Cats" purrs from the page with a pair of leering feline eyes. "The Phantom of the Opera" haunts with its celebrated half-mask.
But while Broadway marketers have long employed snazzy visuals in their marketing matter, they no longer have the game to themselves in this image-conscious and financially needy decade for the arts. Regional theaters are copying from their commercial cousins.
When "A Clockwork Orange" played at the Steppenwolf Theatre two years ago, it seemed that the logo for the show--a bald man's head with a workman drilling into the skull against a cloud-filled sky--was popping up everywhere. It was the work of Bo Bartlett, a Philadelphia-based painter who has designed images for every subsequent Steppenwolf show. The other big non-profit in town, the Goodman Theatre, also recently made a commitment to work with the same graphic designer for every play in its upcoming season--in this case, Tom Herzberg, a Chicago artist best known for his editorial illustration work in local newspapers and magazines.
Why would a resident theater want to use the same artist for all its images?
" We wanted to create a distinctive and unified visual look that would stand out from the crowd," says Goodman managing director Roche Shulfer. " When we saw Tom's work, there was no doubt that he was the right illustrator for us. There was a humanity about his work but it wasn't sentimental. There was an edge to it, but it was still inviting."
About 18 months ago at Steppenwolf, marketing director Tim Evans found himself trying to sell tickets to a theater that was going through an internal identity crisis as it approached its 20th birthday. The theater's logo was 10 years old. All of the imaging was being done by different people. The very notion of "Steppenwolf" was increasingly unclear in the target audience's minds.
So Evans decided it was time to co-ordinate the company's images and identity, making them unified across the board. Terry Kinney, one of the Steppenwolf founders, suggested Bartlett, with whom he had previously produced a small documentary. Even though the painter had never done this kind of work before, he agreed to the assignment.
"I liked Bo's realism," says Evans. "There is an undercurrent of crisis to his work--a great, edgy energy that he puts forth in all his paintings."
Whether the image in question is a figure carrying corn for Steppenwolf's "Buried Child" or a devil holding a guitar for the Goodman's "Randy Newman's Faust," the process for the generation of the image is similar. After reading the script, the designer talks to the show's director (as well as to people in the marketing office) and then sketches several images that somehow capture the essence of the show. There can be many masters to serve: Marketing people like graphics that sell tickets, directors can be obsessed with their concept, and the designer wants to create a stand-alone piece of art. Still, one predominant image usually rises to the top.
Take Herzberg's "Faust" logo. His first ideas were very literal and representational--essentially representations of scenes from the play. Then he changed his approach.
"I decided to work more from an abstract place," Herzberg remembers. "At no point in the play does Lucifer actually play the guitar. I wanted to encapsulate the themes of the play--the devil and the fact that the show is a musical. So I played with the idea of red-hot guitar music and turned Lucifer almost into James Dean."
Bartlett's Steppenwolf image for "Molly Sweeney" (a woman riding her bike along the beach with a pair of eyes looking outward from the sky) is equally oblique. And even though the bicycle ride is mentioned in the script only in passing, the picture makes perfect sense to anyone who has seen this Brian Friel play about a blind woman who regains her vision but loses her inner sight.
"I've been really enjoying doing these shows," says Bartlett. "I'm not really in this business, but these are my friends and if they're happy, I'm happy."
Of course, the vast majority of Chicago theaters do not enjoy the luxury of large budgets that are set aside to hire top artists and graphic designers. But some cash-starved troupes still manage to create very impressive graphics. Typically, the artist they hire needs an additional qualification--a willingness to work for little or nothing.
Next Theatre has used designer Charlie Athanas for shows like "Almost Blue" and "Son of Celluloid." ("He gets his point across from a poor theater standpoint," says artistic director Steve Pickering.) Athanas' work is particularly adept at capturing the attention of a young, non-theater crowd (Next's target audience) because he tends to use high-impact images that make many references to other forms of popular culture.
Red Orchid Theatre has turned a few heads with a series of striking graphic images for shows like "The Caine Mutiny Court-Martial" (a strawberry in the middle of a black field) and "Canus Lunis Balloonis" (a dog howling at a moon that's stuck between power lines). They're the work of Stephen Neale.
"I work for free because it's an opportunity for me to do graphic design that is uncorrupted," says Neale (a full-time art director for a big agency). "In my professional life, the work I do gets changed a lot. Red Orchid gives me creative freedom."
Although they are clearly enjoyable to create, these graphic representations of theatrical works certainly do not represent pure artistic whimsy. They must be flexible enough to be reproduced in newspapers, etched on banners, ironed across T-shirts, cut-and-pasted into newsletters. And their ultimate aim is to attract the unsuspecting eye and sell tickets. That's why theater people are paying these little flat dramas so much attention.
"There are few things that occupy so much of our time on a daily basis," says the Goodman's Shulfer, "as the development of our image."

`CATCH ME' ISN'T WORTH THE CHASE

Author: Chris Jones. Special to the Tribune.

http://turing.library.northwestern.edu/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/291152683?accountid=12861

Abstract: When "Catch Me If You Can" first opened on Broadway in 1965, the Great White Way was still an accommodating place for slick, plot-driven thrillers that provided a few thrills for an upper-middle-class urban audience looking for a relaxing night out after a hard day's work and several cocktails. Like many of the other forgotten commercial writers of the time, Willie Gilbert and Jack Weinstock knew how to keep the box office busy. Setting their show in a familiar place (the Catskills), they mixed together a dry Jewish cop, an effusive Irish priest, a beautiful femme fatale, a hearty German sandwich shop owner, and a dumb-as-dishwater floozy. There was a place back then for the stereotypical murder mystery and there is one now. Revivals of shows such as "Deathtrap," "Dial M For Murder" and "The Mousetrap" are still enjoyable. But the lame "Catch Me If You Can" makes those thrillers look like Shakespeare's Greatest Works.

Setting their show in a familiar place (the Catskills), they mixed together a dry Jewish cop, an effusive Irish priest, a beautiful femme fatale, a hearty German sandwich shop owner, and a dumb-as-dishwater floozy.
Most important, they crafted a constantly twisting plot around an everyman figure with whose befuddlement the audience could identify (the spectator was assumed to be male). In this play, it's a middle-aged advertising executive whose wife disappears, only to be replaced by a strange woman he has never seen before, but who now claims to be his spouse.
There was a place back then for the stereotypical murder mystery and there is one now. Revivals of shows such as "Deathtrap," "Dial M For Murder" and "The Mousetrap" are still enjoyable. But the lame "Catch Me If You Can" makes those thrillers look like Shakespeare's Greatest Works.
The play, currently under revival in Evergreen Park, is a formulaic and witless concoction of ethnic and theatrical stereotypes that makes you marvel at what used to sell tickets. Sure, there are a few interesting twists in the plot, but no strong characters or illumination into the human condition. Even the laughs are few and far between.
The only way to make this nonsense work today is to play it as an amusing period piece (like the recent tour of "Dial M"). Sadly, director David Mink unwisely chooses to update the script, interjecting absurdly incongruous references to Dr. Ruth and Michael Bolton. One character even threatens to "break that CD," a line that lacks the resonance of the original ("break that record").
Judging by the set of confused and half-hearted performances, the actors don't have much confidence in their material. David Lively's cop is underplayed, while Dexter Zollicoffer's priest is miles over the top--as are Deborah Leydig and Dev Kennedy, in truly hapless roles as a shallow married couple. Malcolm Rothman at least seems to enjoy his Germanic sandwich maker, and leads John Cooke and Kathryn Jaeck (as the perhaps-married couple) turn in competent performances. But no one has the necessary slick style.
Producer John Lazzara always makes an honest effort to give his audiences what they say they want. But there are far better thrillers available for production than this piece of period pabulum.

RETURN VISIT MATURE `WRENS' VIVIDLY ETCHES WOMEN'S LIVES

Author: Chris Jones. Special to the Tribune.

http://turing.library.northwestern.edu/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/291168598?accountid=12861

Abstract: Born of poignant personal experience, Anne McGravie's "Wrens," a warm, woman-centered play about wartime life, was a big success last spring at the Footsteps Theatre, so tiny it felt like the audience was sharing a hut with the seven British characters. And while the Organic studio lacks the physical immediacy of Footsteps, Karen Kessler and Scott Verissimo's first-rate production has clearly matured with time. All of the original cast has returned.

Full text: Born of poignant personal experience, Anne McGravie's "Wrens," a warm, woman-centered play about wartime life, was a big success last spring at the Footsteps Theatre, so tiny it felt like the audience was sharing a hut with the seven British characters. And while the Organic studio lacks the physical immediacy of Footsteps, Karen Kessler and Scott Verissimo's first-rate production has clearly matured with time. All of the original cast has returned.
Although the Women's Royal Naval Service (WRENS) allowed women to serve, it was a segregated unit. Lower in status, pay and personal freedom, the Wrens were subject to a rigorous moral code. Set entirely in the rough-hewn Scottish barracks the Wrens must call home, McGravie's moving drama chronicles the dreams and dilemmas of a group of young women coping with forced confinement.
The action here revolves around the pregnancy of a vulnerable young Wren named Dawn (Andrea Stark). But McGravie is mainly interested in how women from different geographical areas and social classes interact.
Cynthia (Meighan Gerachis), is the uptight product of a public school. Doris (Linda M. Waste) is a wistful intellectual who uses tea as an emotional crutch. Jenny (Victoria Delorio) finds her religious conservatism tested by real-life events. Gwyneth (Tara Mallen) tries to become a leader, while young orphan Meg (Mary Cross) learns about womanhood. Lastly, there's Chelsea (Karen Hammer), a smoking cool customer who stays above the emotional fray.
By the end of the gently feminist two-hour drama, these clearly defined young women are vividly etched. McGravie wisely lets the issues in her play (women's roles in the armed forces, abortion, class-based politics) slowly emerge from what appears to be the genuine interaction of character. This is a slow-building play that will appeal most to the patient listener.
Gerachis is particularly funny and believable, but there are no weak links in the young ensemble cast. All of the women sport flawless British regional accents and have shaped and honed their characters beautifully.
It's worth noting that McGravie is a local writer, a mature woman who lived through the war. "Wrens" deserves publication and future production--colleges are clamoring for a show with all these juicy female roles.

FEMALE CAST TAMES DARKNESS OF "SHREW'

Author: Chris Jones. Special to the Tribune.

http://turing.library.northwestern.edu/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/291168979?accountid=12861

Abstract: By casting all of the roles with women, Footsteps director Jean Adamak undermines the play's paternalistic sensibility. And the result is a funny and highly enjoyable show that rescues much of the play's physical comedy from the darker implications of physical abuse. When Petruchio (Dawn Alden) and Kate (Sandy Borglum) are well played by women, all the troubling gender issues are subverted, producing a gaggle of fascinating theatrical implications.

Full text: Based so explicitly on the comic subordination of a strong woman, "The Taming of the Shrew" is one of the most difficult Shakespearian texts to perform today.
Modern directors have tried every trick to make the inherent sexism less offensive: Katerina can deliver her final submissive speech with an ironic wink; Petruchio and his strong-willed bride can appear to be playing some mutually satisfying sexual game; or (if the oft-cut prologue is retained) the whole play-within-a-play can be presented as Christopher Sly's drunken fantasy.
Try as one may, though, it's still tough to wring postmodern yuks out of a show that treats its central female character as if she were a horse to be broken.
By casting all of the roles with women, Footsteps director Jean Adamak undermines the play's paternalistic sensibility. And the result is a funny and highly enjoyable show that rescues much of the play's physical comedy from the darker implications of physical abuse. When Petruchio (Dawn Alden) and Kate (Sandy Borglum) are well played by women, all the troubling gender issues are subverted, producing a gaggle of fascinating theatrical implications.
Aside from the radical all-female troupe, Adamak's simple and accessible production is otherwise surprisingly traditional (probably too much so). Borrowing from Goldoni-esque Italian farce, Adamak and her tights-clad cast have nonetheless developed a succession of funny and inventive comic bits--props fly around, the leads end up fighting on the floor, and a pair of dogs shows up on the stage.
There are a few rough performances in the minor roles and the ersatz Renaissance style is sometimes inconsistent and cliched. But the lead players are funny and thoughtful and there's strong support from Michele DiMaso, who's consistently energetic and amusing as Tranio.
One can imagine many more radical possibilities for reinterpretations of this troubling play--gender reversal rather than elimination is particularly tantalizing. Still, Adamak's worthwhile version manages to be provocative and full of good laughs.

GOULET STILL A BIG DRAW ON LIVE-THEATER CIRCUIT

Author: Chris Jones. Special to the Tribune.

http://turing.library.northwestern.edu/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/291178146?accountid=12861

Abstract: As Robert Goulet hopped down from his dressing-room tub in Vienna, Va., the other week before performing the role of Don Quixote in his current tour of "The Man of La Mancha," the rug slipped out from under him.

Full text: As Robert Goulet hopped down from his dressing-room tub in Vienna, Va., the other week before performing the role of Don Quixote in his current tour of "The Man of La Mancha," the rug slipped out from under him.
"I went on that night but the high notes came out strangely," Goulet, 62, remembers. "I could see the audience nudging each other and saying, `He's getting old. His voice is going.' "
"I cracked two ribs and one record that week."
The bones have mended and the notes are back in their signature shape, but the record is still smashed: "Man of La Mancha" grossed more than $1 million in a single week at the Wolf Trap theater, becoming the best-selling musical in that venue's history. Goulet brings "La Mancha" to the Rosemont Theatre this week.
As he has proved over the past few years by hawking long-touring revivals of "South Pacific," "Camelot" and "The Fantasticks," no one sells tickets on the road like the handsome baritone who shot to fame in 1960 as Broadway's first Sir Lancelot.
Where does he find the energy to run around the country warbling romantic standards such as "The Impossible Dream" when he could be making movies or floating on his yacht somewhere?
"The live theater gives me the chance to do meaningful work," says Goulet, who has been talking a lot recently about his battle with prostate cancer. "I'm a basket case when I'm not working. When people stand up and applaud, it makes all the effort worthwhile."
Theatrical commitment coupled with box-office cache gives Goulet big appeal for writers of new work. Leslie Bricusse is composing a musical about Henry VIII; Goulet is already looking forward to playing the starring monarch -- in theaters all across the country.
----------
"Man of La Mancha" opens Tuesday at the Rosemont Theatre, 5400 N. River Rd., Rosemont. Tickets range from $19.50 to $49.50. Phone 312-902-1500.

`JESUS' LEAVES QUESTIONS UNANSWERED

http://turing.library.northwestern.edu/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/291174498?accountid=12861

Abstract: The exploratory device is a television talk show. At the behest of a boorish young host (Morocco Omari, who sometimes overacts), three former members of the Jesus reunite and discuss their past after the violent death of their leader, Bobby Wright (Clifton Williams), a k a Huey P. Newton. Modeled on Bobby Seale, Jonathan Morrison (Freeman Coffey) is now an angry security chief unable to accept the flaws of his former idol. Rakim Shabazz (Robert Barnett) has become a Muslim and found intelligent peace with his past. Cassandra Taylor Atkinson (Cherise Thurman) must reconcile political progress with the sexism of her Black Jesus experience.

Full text: David Barr is a playwright with nerve. His drama, "The Death of the Black Jesus," takes on so many hot-button issues of contemporary racial politics, it's remarkable the venerable stage of the Chicago Theatre Company did not catch fire.
In its current form, the play's committed complexity is its undoing--Barr explores so many intricate and involved questions, his drama lacks focus and clarity. But hidden under some distractions is a powerful piece of new writing from a talented Chicago actor turned scribe.
The titular Black Jesus is no African-American Messiah. Rather, Barr uses the term as a metaphor for the revolutionary political group, the Black Panthers. His play is concerned with the legacy of the Panthers' struggle and the rightful place in contemporary society of its former members.
The exploratory device is a television talk show. At the behest of a boorish young host (Morocco Omari, who sometimes overacts), three former members of the Jesus reunite and discuss their past after the violent death of their leader, Bobby Wright (Clifton Williams), a k a Huey P. Newton. Modeled on Bobby Seale, Jonathan Morrison (Freeman Coffey) is now an angry security chief unable to accept the flaws of his former idol. Rakim Shabazz (Robert Barnett) has become a Muslim and found intelligent peace with his past. Cassandra Taylor Atkinson (Cherise Thurman) must reconcile political progress with the sexism of her Black Jesus experience.
There are some excellent acting moments in Douglas Alan-Mann's solidly directed production. But Barr should downplay some of his easy targets (television executives and white supremacists) and focus on the complex legacy of his ex-radicals. What's the role of older, quieter ex-revolutionaries coming to terms with ambiguity and heartache, but still challenging a society in need of leaders? That's the compelling dramatic--and political--question.

RABE'S `HURLYBURLY' REALLY SHOWS ITS AGE

Author: Chris Jones. Special to the Tribune.

http://turing.library.northwestern.edu/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/291174597?accountid=12861

Abstract: A monument to the decade of excess, "Hurlyburly" is one of those realistic and domestic "consumption plays," so beloved in the early 1980s. Hardly a line is spoken without someone drinking something, or smoking something, or snorting something. And as the (usually male) tortured central characters overindulge, abusing themselves and those (usually needy women) unfortunate enough to be hanging around them, they discover their lots in life are rather pathetic. In 1996, it's hard to care about this bunch of Hollywood sleazes and their self-induced personal crises.

Full text: It does not take long for a cutting-edge contemporary drama to become a period piece.
Watching a revival of David Rabe's "Hurlyburly" 12 years after this tempestuous show premiered at the Goodman and went on to a successful run on Broadway, it's striking how distant this play now seems from our current reality.
A monument to the decade of excess, "Hurlyburly" is one of those realistic and domestic "consumption plays," so beloved in the early 1980s. Hardly a line is spoken without someone drinking something, or smoking something, or snorting something. And as the (usually male) tortured central characters overindulge, abusing themselves and those (usually needy women) unfortunate enough to be hanging around them, they discover their lots in life are rather pathetic. In 1996, it's hard to care about this bunch of Hollywood sleazes and their self-induced personal crises.
Still, as the genre goes, this is one of the best works. Given Rabe's linguistic mastery of the middle-class male psyche, the play is a natural for young companies looking for gutsy roles for their ensemble. Firstborn Productions is a group of recent graduates from Southern Illinois University. For the most part, these actors do truthful work, although they do not entirely master the ebb and flow of three hours of explosive interaction in a single setting.
As the two roommates at the play's conflicted heart, Jason Jones and Kirk Gillman are verbally fluent and convincingly neurotic. While the older characters do not work as well here, Andrea Washburn is also excellent as the young drifter who has a stronger sense of self than the men who abuse her. Although the show sags toward the end, director Gregory Gerhard provides some intelligent shape. Design elements (especially Benjamin White's lighting) are superior to what one normally finds at this budgetary level.

`VANYA' TAKES A SERIOUS TURN PRODUCTION OF CHEKHOV'S CLASSIC SACRIFICES HUMOR FOR SLAVIC AUTHENTICITY

Author: Chris Jones. Special to the Tribune.

http://turing.library.northwestern.edu/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/291184718?accountid=12861

Abstract: Perhaps it's the influence of a Russian-speaking Bulgarian director and his assistant from St. Petersburg, but there's a real sense of Slavic authenticity to the serious but nonetheless impressive production of Anton Chekhov's "Uncle Vanya," currently playing at the tiny European Repertory Theatre. Director Yasen Peyankov has cobbled together his own smart and lean translation of the Chekhov classic, using a literal translation and the original Russian text. He also persuaded well-trained actors of mature age to join his cast--something of a rarity in a small non-Equity troupe.

Full text: Perhaps it's the influence of a Russian-speaking Bulgarian director and his assistant from St. Petersburg, but there's a real sense of Slavic authenticity to the serious but nonetheless impressive production of Anton Chekhov's "Uncle Vanya," currently playing at the tiny European Repertory Theatre.
Director Yasen Peyankov has cobbled together his own smart and lean translation of the Chekhov classic, using a literal translation and the original Russian text. He also persuaded well-trained actors of mature age to join his cast--something of a rarity in a small non-Equity troupe.
The resultant product is a thoughtful, poignant and (especially given the diminutive budget) beautifully visualized revival of Chekov's tragicomic study of disaffection with Russian provincial life. Robert Whitaker's quietly attractive set and lighting designs make excellent use of the European Repertory's intimate church space.
The two most important characters here are Uncle Vanya Voynitsky himself (Bob Kallus), a sad middle-age man whose main achievement in life is firing a revolver at the hated Professor Serebraykov (Rich Baker), who is visiting and upsetting the provinces with his beautiful young wife, Elena (Carolyn Hoerdemann). Vulnerable and bumbling, Kallus turns in a powerful performance in the pivotal role.
The real treat on Wellington Street, though, is Susan Bennett; she's remarkably good as smart but plain Sonya, a Chekhovian depressive who fails to capture the man she loves, Astrov (Richard Edward Frederick), and then sinks into a sad malaise of non-achievement. Bennett's work is poignant, compelling and exceptionally well-crafted.
Some of the performers in other roles do not work quite as well--Hoerdemann tries her considerable best, but she's miscast. And those who think Chekhovian productions live and die based on how funny they seem will be disappointed that the play's comic moments do not have more focus.
What Peyankov lacks in money and humor here, he makes up for in knowledge of native Chekhovian rhythms. One has a strong sense of the characters' longings for a better, more exciting life; which is, after all, the heart of a play that reveals more every time it is played.

SPACE ALIENS, DEMONS RETURN FOR AN ENCORE

Author: Chris Jones. Special to the Tribune.

http://turing.library.northwestern.edu/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/291169429?accountid=12861

Abstract: In Rainer Werner Fassbinder's dark drama, "Blood on the Cat's Neck," an alien named Phoebe Zeitgeist is sent from a distant star to write an eyewitness account of human democracy. So when Andrew Cooper Wasser set about staging the twisted piece of Germanic theater at Bucktown's Trapdoor Theatre last spring, he decided to ask the actress who played Phoebe to appear naked.

Full text: In Rainer Werner Fassbinder's dark drama, "Blood on the Cat's Neck," an alien named Phoebe Zeitgeist is sent from a distant star to write an eyewitness account of human democracy. So when Andrew Cooper Wasser set about staging the twisted piece of Germanic theater at Bucktown's Trapdoor Theatre last spring, he decided to ask the actress who played Phoebe to appear naked.
Wasser says his directorial decision had nothing to do with voyeurism or box-office appeal. "Phoebe's nakedness alienates her from everyone else in the play, " Wasser insists. "Fassbinder wrote this play to show people that human beings are cruel. Phoebe takes in this cruelty and then spits it back in people's faces." (By the end of the show, Phoebe has had enough of Homo sapiens in action, and becomes a decidedly unfriendly alien.)
Founded in 1994 by Beata Pilch and Sean Marlowe, the earthy Trapdoor has specialized in eclectic European fare -- Wasser's show sparked so much interest that "Blood" returns to the Trap on Wednesday. Come November, the risky show moves to the larger, lusher Mercury Theatre in a late-night slot. Trap Door Theatre, 1655 W. Cortland Ave. Call 312-384-0494.
"The Demon Diner" also reopens its doors this weekend. Sans Fassbinder pretension, this gore-fest features the eaterie of one Mrs. Pontalukos and her husband. Secret Satan worshipers both, the couple hold a teenage dance at their place and turn the school into what author Keith Tadrowski describes as "blood-sucking freaks."
Tadrowski unconvincingly insists that the show (which had audiences howling with laughter at the Bailiwick last year) has a point. "It's an attack on family values," he says. "We want to show the other side of the 1950s."
Produced by Who Threw That Ham productions, the menu at this splatter diner is for adults only. ImprovOlympic, 3541 N. Clark. Call 312-880-0199.

Full text: Playwright Lee Blessing's great strength is taking the kind of juicy contemporary theme beloved of TV movies, and then exploring that topic far beyond what television could ever stomach. In his provocative one-act, "Down the Road," Blessing follows a husband-and-wife team of biographers (Julie Eudeikis and John Farrimond) as they interview a grisly serial killer (Chuck Quinn) for a lucrative but bloody tell-all. Vincent P. Mahler's simple but well-staged Frump Tucker Theatre Company production at Angel Island serves the play's themes with considerable understanding. Although all three actors are solid, Eudeikis is particularly vulnerable and intelligent as a writer struggling to reconcile communal morality, money and personal distaste. Call 312-409-2689.

HANNIBAL LECTER RETURNS IN `RED DRAGON'

Author: Jones, Chris

http://turing.library.northwestern.edu/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/291160829?accountid=12861

Abstract: Lecter is the creation of reclusive novelist Thomas Harris, author of the original narrative version of "The Silence of the Lambs." But before Lecter locked minds with FBI trainee Clarice Starling on the pages of Harris' novel, the articulate sociopath was introduced to the world in a thriller called "Red Dragon," in which an agent trying to delve into the mind of another serial killer looks to the caged doctor for advice. Even though this 1981 novel was filmed by Michael Mann in 1986 (under the title "Manhunter"), it's now the subject of a new theatrical adaptation by Christopher Johnson of Chicago's Defiant Theatre.

Full text: Thanks mainly to Anthony Hopkins' beguiling performance in the film version of "The Silence of the Lambs," fictional serial killer Dr. Hannibal Lecter occupies a prominent place in the nightmares of many Americans.
Alternately gentle and savage, but always brilliantly intelligent, Lecter's appeal lies in his moral ambiguity. The character confuses standard moral boundaries and refuses to conform to the Hollywood stereotype of evil. He is, therefore, all the more terrifying.
Lecter is the creation of reclusive novelist Thomas Harris, author of the original narrative version of "The Silence of the Lambs." But before Lecter locked minds with FBI trainee Clarice Starling on the pages of Harris' novel, the articulate sociopath was introduced to the world in a thriller called "Red Dragon," in which an agent trying to delve into the mind of another serial killer looks to the caged doctor for advice. Even though this 1981 novel was filmed by Michael Mann in 1986 (under the title "Manhunter"), it's now the subject of a new theatrical adaptation by Christopher Johnson of Chicago's Defiant Theatre.
An adventurous theater company formed in Champaign in 1990 by "disgruntled University of Illinois students," the troupe moved to Chicago in 1993.
"Our mission is to do theater that takes people away from television," says Defiant's executive director, Jeff Arena, explaining his group's penchant for the graphic and the guttural. "We are not here to do Neil Simon."
Nobody is likely to confuse "Red Dragon" with "The Last of the Red-Hot Lovers." The former's fire-breather is based on one of William Blake's drug-induced paintings.
Defiant is presenting "Red Dragon" in Bucktown's 70-seat Firehouse. Arena confesses the intimacy of the environment worries him a little. "I hope people are not too upset by the graphic elements of the show," he says.

"Red Dragon" plays at The Firehouse, 1625 N. Damen Ave., through Nov. 23. For tickets and more information, call 312-357-3461.

Abstract: Written before "The Silence of the Lambs," "Red Dragon" was filmed in 1986 as "Manhunter." The story follows the investigation of an FBI agent named Will Graham (played by Dan Smith) into the crimes of serial killer Francis Dolarhyde (Chris Thometz). Befuddled by the violent deaths and corpses disfigured by bite marks, the agent turns for insight to the hyper-intelligent Hannibal Lechter (Richard Ragsdale), a former adversary whom he sent behind bars.

Full text: Christopher Johnson's endlessly violent adaptation of Thomas Harris' "Red Dragon" is one of those honorable theatrical disasters. A slew of great dramatic ideas swirl haplessly around the stage for more than three hours and the Defiant Theatre takes all manner of personal and professional risks, blanketing its impoverished soul in blood and gore trying to tell this complicated story. Sadly, very little works.
Written before "The Silence of the Lambs," "Red Dragon" was filmed in 1986 as "Manhunter." The story follows the investigation of an FBI agent named Will Graham (played by Dan Smith) into the crimes of serial killer Francis Dolarhyde (Chris Thometz). Befuddled by the violent deaths and corpses disfigured by bite marks, the agent turns for insight to the hyper-intelligent Hannibal Lechter (Richard Ragsdale), a former adversary whom he sent behind bars.
By describing in detail the torrent of childhood abuses suffered by the young and disfigured Dolarhyde, Harris is at pains to note that society must bare responsibility for its miscreants. And by simultaneously tracking the lives and fears of both killer and detective, Harris employs the psychological trickery familiar to anyone who saw Anthony Hopkins terrorize Jodie Foster.
To overcome the competition of film, Johnson pulls out every imaginable theatrical trick. There are violent (be warned!) home movies of Dolarhyde's murders shown on a wing-shaped screen. A leather-clad percussionist underscores the show with all kinds of (mainly irritating) bangs. In the third act, an ersatz Asian dragon appears, manipulated by several performers. And the large cast constantly wears more blood than clothes in the service of off-Loop art.
But it's the theatrical basics that needed attention. Far too many short scenes and blackouts prevent the building of tension. The pivotal performance of Smith is so understated that one can barely hear his lines. There is too much mutually exclusive gimmickry and insufficient attention to focused acting and directing. And the show is far too long.
Only the hard-working Thometz is consistently worth watching. His portrait of a killer as a young victim is both honest and disturbing--and the single reason to suffer through the rest of "Red Dragon."

THEATER HOPES TO MOVE INTO THE LIMELIGHT

Abstract: For the past 11 years, the American Blues Theatre has been quietly producing its signature brand of gutsy new plays with a working-class flavor. Mounting only three or four shows each season, American Blues has neither sought nor gained a high profile in the competitive world of Chicago theater. American Blues has no subscription series or glossy brochure, and it has spent the past three years on out-of-the-way West Byron Street, in its own 140-seat theater. Personnel have tended to come and go. Of the founders, only Jim Leaming is involved with the theater on a day-to-day basis, although playwright Rick Cleveland, former artistic director William Payne and actor Edward Blatchford still keep in touch from out of town. Most significant, American Blues is poised to hire its first full-time artistic director. While no contract has yet been signed (and the deal could still fall through), Brian Russell confirms that he is "engaged in serious conversation" with present co-artistic directors Carmen Roman and Marty Higginbotham.

Full text: For the past 11 years, the American Blues Theatre has been quietly producing its signature brand of gutsy new plays with a working-class flavor. Mounting only three or four shows each season, American Blues has neither sought nor gained a high profile in the competitive world of Chicago theater.
American Blues has no subscription series or glossy brochure, and it has spent the past three years on out-of-the-way West Byron Street, in its own 140-seat theater. Personnel have tended to come and go. Of the founders, only Jim Leaming is involved with the theater on a day-to-day basis, although playwright Rick Cleveland, former artistic director William Payne and actor Edward Blatchford still keep in touch from out of town.
But American Blues also has virtually no debt, and its current leadership has seemingly limitless energy. And those factors, and others, suggest that this long-established theater (by Chicago standards) will be rising to a much greater level of visibility.
Most significant, American Blues is poised to hire its first full-time artistic director. While no contract has yet been signed (and the deal could still fall through), Brian Russell confirms that he is "engaged in serious conversation" with present co-artistic directors Carmen Roman and Marty Higginbotham.
With an annual budget of only about $150,000, hiring a full-time artistic honcho would be a major undertaking for the theater's board of directors (currently, the only year-round position at American Blues is a business manager). But Roman argues that the theater is ready for such a move.
"We're being very sensible about what we can accomplish," Roman says. "But everybody has great enthusiasm for growth."
"I firmly believe that are no rewards without risk," Russell says.
Currently associate artistic director at the Northlight Theater, Russell, 33, would be leaving a plum job at Chicago's third-largest theater company to join American Blues. He seems eager to take the chance.
"American Blues is at the point where it is ready to grow and become more of a major force in Chicago theater," Russell says. "And the people there seem to think that I might be helpful to them."
Even before the expected Russell deal is inked, American Blues is producing at a much more prolific rate. Last weekend saw the closing of "The Flight of the Phoenix." Although reviews of the show were mixed, the production was widely praised for its physical spectacle; designer Patrick Kerwin's replica of a World War II transport plane crash-landed on the American Blues stage and was pieced together by the characters in the play during the second act.
Opening on Sunday in the wake of "Phoenix" is "Don't Disappoint Captain January," a quirky new comedy, set in Chicago, by local playwright Joseph Urbinato. The play, which is primarily concerned with troubled, complex mother-daughter relationships, has as its principal characters a widow obsessed with Shirley Temple movies (hence the titular "Captain January") and two grown-up daughters who juggle the needs of their eccentric mother with the demands of their decidedly offbeat boyfriends.
"It's a farcical comedy about love and forgiveness, " says Urbinato (who is also a professional bassoonist and teacher). "My play explores the sorry state of introspection in contemporary life."
Although "Don't Disappoint Captain January" was read by several Chicago theaters, this will be the first major production of one of Urbinato's works. He's clearly both nervous and delighted.
"As a writer, I am interested in human nature," Urbinato says. "This play is about the importance of looking inside oneself."
One of the reasons American Blues is suddenly able to do so much theater is Roman's long-standing belief in the importance of co-productions. This weekend's opening has some outside funding -- a group of private investors that go by the name of Premiere Productions. The same team is joining forces for a co-production of Donald Bevan and Edmund Trzcinski's "Stalag 17" (coordinated by executive producer Michael Weber and directed by Shattered Globe's Louis Conteh) this January. And come March, American Blues is joining with well-known commercial producer Jeffrey McCourt on a revival of Lillian Hellman's "Toys in the Attic."
Kate Buddeke, one of the best known members of the 15-member American Blues ensemble of actors and other theater artists, will join Roman in playing the two sisters at the heart of this classic, woman-centered American play.
With several midsize Chicago theaters merging or disappearing, there's a growing vacuum that a new, energized American Blues might be able to fill. A full union contract seems to be on the cards for the future. And if Russell is hired, it's likely there will soon be an American Blues subscription series on West Byron.

REMY BUMPPO OFF ON THE RIGHT FOOT

Author: Chris Jones. Special to the Tribune.

http://turing.library.northwestern.edu/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/291190803?accountid=12861

Abstract: None available.

Full text: A well-acted and smartly directed revival of a challenging piece of British drama, Remy Bumppo's classy production of Tom Stoppard's "Night and Day" is an auspicious beginning for Chicago's newest professional theater company.
Set in a fictional African nation, the rarely revived "Night and Day" was influenced by Evelyn Waugh's "Scoop." But the play's predominant concern with the nature and limits of political and personal freedom also reflects Stoppard's Czechoslovakian heritage. One can clearly see Stoppard's abiding distrust of unions and socialist dogma; a trait that sets this author apart from most of his peers.
Anyone who has seen "Arcadia" is familiar with Stoppard's prismatic use of language. For "Night and Day," Stoppard turns his verbal faucet on a group of characters caught in the middle of a brewing civil war. Industrialist Geoffrey Carson (Ned Schmidtke) juggles copper mines and his bored, neurotic wife, Ruth (Lia Mortensen). Their home is plagued by journalists all looking for a scoop: a sanguine photographer (Mark Vann), a hard-bitten Australian reporter (Si Osborne) and a naive, freelance union-buster from East Yorkshire (Paul Ratliff). Ultimately the president (Michael Quaintance) shows up in the Carson living room, ready to confront the world press.
Director James Bohnen has cast some of Chicago's best actors, and the mature cast is uniformly good.
Remy Bumppo (an anagram of the company's three founders) has invested much money in this show. And the talky, slightly dated "Night and Day" does not pander to the populist. But for audiences who like their theater thoughtful and articulate, there is a great deal here to enjoy.

GREASY JOAN TROUPE IN PIVOTAL 2ND SEASON

Author: Chris Jones. Special to the Tribune.

Abstract: Don't expect light commercial comedies on the second-year bill, though. After "[Pericles]," Greasy Joan is presenting "Iphigenia and Other Daughters," Ellen McLaughlin's version of the Greek tales of the aftermath of the Trojan War. Next May, Curt Columbus adapts and directs "The Wise Fool," a dramatization of the Ostrovsky satire.

Full text: This story contains corrected material. The name of the Court Theatre was misspelled in the published story.
In a city where new theater troupes often fade with the seasons, a group's second year of operation is often far more important than its first.
Companies usually start out in a blaze of optimism, predicting they will change the city's theatrical landscape. But after a year or so, dreams have to be tempered by reality. Critics have delivered their verdicts. Audiences may or may not have shown up. The novelty of a name will have long worn off. And money is probably in very short supply. That's when company members start wondering if their dream can last.
Take the current situation with the amusingly named Greasy Joan & Company (the name comes from a reference in William Shakespeare's "Love's Labour's Lost").
Last March, the members of this performance collective sat in a Chicago coffee bar and laid out their plans for their first season, which began with an actor-centered production of Middleton and Rowley's fiendishly difficult Jacobean tragedy, "The Changeling," at the rented Famous Door Theater. Greasy Joan, its founders said, would be a serious theater company dedicated to the detailed exploration of classic plays.
On paper, the company looked impressive.
The eight-strong ensemble included five graduates of Robert Brustein's prestigious Institute for Advanced Theater Training at Harvard University. Artistic director Brad Shelton had impressive credits as an actor at the American Repertory Theater in Cambridge. Gavin Witt, well-respected dramaturge for the Court Theatre, had joined the company (this sentence as published has been corrected in this text).
The advisory board was composed of upscale theatrical names -- including Brustein, Claire Bloom and the University of Chicago's David Bevington.
And the members of the company had already persuaded their friends and relatives to contribute some $35,000 towards the first season.
Then "The Changeling" opened to luke-warm critical response. Even though many people admired the actors' craft, the complexity of the text seemed overwhelming.
A follow-up production of Eugene Ionesco's "Jack" was thoughtful but rushed. And while many people admired Greasy Joan's version of Samuel Beckett's "Endgame," it was produced right after the Splinter Group's massive "Buckets of Beckett" festival, a time when most potential audience members were mighty sick of hearing about the Anglo-Irish absurdist.
Such mistakes (overambition, bad scheduling) are typical of new theater companies and forgivable. And Greasy Joan demonstrated its considerable collective talents during its first year.
But as the troupe prepares to open its second season this weekend with a production (at Facets Multimedia) of Shakespeare's rarely produced "Pericles," the Greasy Joaners seem to realize that the next seven months are pivotal.
"We will either make a major jump this year," Shelton says, "or we will become yet another small Chicago theater company not making a living."
"And that," he says, weary of the day-job grind, "is not something any of us are interested in being."
Thus Greasy Joan has made some changes. "Last year we were on a high learning curve," Shelton reflects. "We know now that we want to spend more time in rehearsals and not just throw a show together and short-change it.
"We're discovering that we really want to focus on our process and on our work as a collective."
Don't expect light commercial comedies on the second-year bill, though. After "Pericles," Greasy Joan is presenting "Iphigenia and Other Daughters," Ellen McLaughlin's version of the Greek tales of the aftermath of the Trojan War. Next May, Curt Columbus adapts and directs "The Wise Fool," a dramatization of the Ostrovsky satire.
But that's only three shows in twice as many months, a far more realistic pace than last spring's frantic rush to production. At $55,000, the new season's budget is small but reasonable.
And right now, the Greasy Joaners are understandably focused on "Pericles."
Although it was produced some years ago by the much-bigger Shakespeare Repertory in 1992 and by Bailiwick Repertory in 1984, "Pericles" is seldom performed, probably because of its unwieldy nature.
The plot is amazingly convoluted -- there's an incestuous relationship, a storm at sea, a nasty shipwreck, assorted pirates and a climactic magical and romantic rebirth at the Temple of Diana.
"This play reflects a man who is late in his life and beginning to embrace the magical and imaginative realm of theater," says co- director Gavin Witt (Brendon Fox shares the creative helm).
"This play is so intimate, spare and pure. We are approaching it from the point of view of honest storytelling."
Witt says he is using only eight actors to cover the play's 30- plus characters, doubling roles with attention to themes (the same actor, for example, is playing the drama's three kings).
Witt has also been fiddling with the fragmented text, borrowing some of the elements from a prose version of the story he discovered. But he is still focusing mainly on "the power of sharing an imaginative tale with an audience."
Simplicity and concentration sound like a good start to an important new year for Greasy Joan, a period of self-exploration and (the company hopes) productions of a higher quality. The members are all longing to delve into classical texts on a full-time basis.
"We really feel like part-time theater suffers," says Shelton. "How long can you allow your art to be compromised while you have to pay your bills?"
----------
Greasy Joan & Company's production of "Pericles" by William Shakespeare is in previews at Facets Multimedia, 1517 W. Fullerton Ave.; opening night is Monday. Tickets are $10-$14. For more information, call 773-761-8284.

THE WET LOOK `SINGIN' IN THE RAIN' MAKES A SPLASH AT MARRIOTT

Author: Chris Jones. Special to the Tribune.

http://turing.library.northwestern.edu/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/291189837?accountid=12861

Abstract: Mark S. Hoebee's fast-paced live production of the classic MGM musical "Singin' in the Rain" has some beautifully executed choreography, truckloads of inventive physical business and piped-in rain aplenty. The story of three buddies negotiating the birth of talking pictures, "Singin' in the Rain" is a deeply romantic tale celebrating love, friendship and honesty. And while there is more than enough competent theatrical business splashing around to keep audiences at Marriott's Lincolnshire Theatre entertained, soggy dance steps cannot substitute for heart and a human connection.

Full text: Mark S. Hoebee's fast-paced live production of the classic MGM musical "Singin' in the Rain" has some beautifully executed choreography, truckloads of inventive physical business and piped-in rain aplenty.
But the wonderful 1952 Technicolor movie was about far more than glitz and puddles.
The story of three buddies negotiating the birth of talking pictures, "Singin' in the Rain" is a deeply romantic tale celebrating love, friendship and honesty. And while there is more than enough competent theatrical business splashing around to keep audiences at Marriott's Lincolnshire Theatre entertained, soggy dance steps cannot substitute for heart and a human connection.
Last seen here in 1995 when the Candlelight Dinner Playhouse presented a scrappier but far more earnest and romantic production, "Singin' in the Rain" is hard to contain in a theater. Aside from the technical complexities of onstage precipitation (amazingly, no one in the Marriott audience gets wet), performers also have to overcome the memory of the amazing celluloid performances by Gene Kelly, Debbie Reynolds and Donald O'Connor.
Because this show began life on film, there are many short scenes that constantly shift location and test the considerable transitional abilities of a theater in the round.
As the trio at the heart of the show, Michael Cline, Mary Beth Dolan and William Akey all hoof (but do not sing) spectacularly well. But Dolan's fixed-smile approach to the soft, girl-next-door character of Kathy Selden seems harsh at times, and we never really see any spark or sexual tension between her and Cline's overly distant Don Lockwood.
The energetic Akey, all pratfalls and funny voices, fares rather better in the role of Cosmo Brown, but he misses the melancholic side of a sidekick best pal looking for his own way to shine.
Unhindered by these emotional demands, the comic supporting cast are all funny--Angela Berra's bleached diva is appropriately raspish, and Kelli Cramer is a stitch in a whole gallery of eccentric cameos.
There's a certain primal joy that comes from watching actors cheerfully splash around in raincoats at the climax of this relentlessly cheery piece of theater. But, rain or shine, there's still a romantic story that must be told.

TOO MUCH OF A GOOD THING FINE IDEAS OVERLAP, OVERWHELMING LOOKINGGLASS' `THE VANISHING TWIN'

Author: Chris Jones. Special to the Tribune.

http://turing.library.northwestern.edu/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/291171802?accountid=12861

Abstract: In the theater, too much talent articulating too many ideas can be a curse. The Lookingglass Theatre Company seems increasingly locked in that curse's grip. The troupe's current production, an inventive but unwieldy Bruce Norris comic concoction titled "The Vanishing Twin," is a classic example of a show with such an embarrassment of theatrical riches that it becomes overwhelmed by its own content. Some of the time, this company-devised piece of Gothic satire plays like a sparkling piece of Charles Ludlum camp. Taking a cue from "Jane Eyre," the daft story follows a Victorian governess who finds herself assigned to a weird Germanic mansion filled with loonies, including a blind woman, a mute and a pair of nastily separated Siamese twins. In classic "Mystery of Irma Vep" fashion, gender-bending performers deliver droll one-liners with deadpan panache.

Then there's the side of the show that wants to be "Rocky Horror" for people too sophisticated for the Time Warp. Every so often, characters pick up guitars and launch into original rock songs.
A couple of these melodic tunes (penned by Norris, company members and guitarist Rick Sims) are genuinely impressive, but they are barely staged and have little connection to the rest of the show. For much of the second act, the music disappears.
Ever physically adroit, the Lookingglass crew enjoys demonstrating its circus skills, so the show features a trapeze routine and other corporal high jinks. And this company made its name through theatricalized storytelling, so that also enters the mix.
Late in the evening, each character takes a turn center stage, describing his or her sordid past. Finally, Norris cannot resist Caryl Churchill-esque comedic social commentary, so the show lampoons racism, economic policy and corporal punishment.
Taken individually, much of this stuff is splendid. Norris' typically intellectual dialogue sparkles with linguistic wit.
Be they in or out of drag, all of the performers are highly accomplished (Raymond Fox as the spinsterish governess and David Kersnar as the Mrs. Danvers-like maid are standouts).
And Dan Ostling's sharply raked setting adds to the fun with many scenic tricks.
But one night of theater (even Lookingglass theater) cannot do everything, and sometimes decent ideas need to be thrown away, lest they obscure better ones.
The more "The Vanishing Twin" showcases its supremely talented and multivalent creators, the less the audience understands what else this long show was supposed to achieve.

Full text: "Girl Theater": A hip and sassy evening of original monologues celebrating the joys of femininity, "Girl Theater" is bringing a little theatrical exuberance to those dreary Monday and Tuesday evenings of this gray November. Delivering some 17 solo pieces in around 90 minutes, the cast of eight lively performers mugs and vamps its way through monologues on assorted topics ranging from sex to motherhood to behaving badly at important social functions (some of the pieces were written by the actors; others were submitted by a host of local writers). There are no great political or dramatic truths on fast-paced display here. But what the cast lacks in diversity of age or race, it makes up for in enthusiasm -- the multiple talents of Gabrielle Kaplan provide much of the humor, and choreographer Jennifer Savarirayan has crafted some slick transitions that nicely enliven the notoriously static monologuic form. National Paastime Theatre, 4139 N. Broadway. Phone 773-227-9505.

AUTHOR SHANGE FIRST ARTIST IN STEPPENWOLF'S MULTI-ARTS SERIES

Author: Jones, Chris

Abstract: Along with trumpeter Lester Bowie and the Ritual Trio, [Ntozake] Shange is here at the behest of Kahil El'Zabar, the curator of Steppenwolf's new interdisciplinary performance season (and the Ritual Trio's percussionist). Dubbed "Traffic," the new Monday-night series, which begins with Shange's performance, includes disparate theater artists and writers, musicians of assorted genres, and raconteurs on the level of Studs Terkel.

Full text: Thanks to the success of plays like "Nomathemba" and "for colored girls who have considered suicide/when the rainbow is enuf," author Ntozake Shange is a familiar name to progressive Chicago theatergoers. But Shange's elliptical, poetic words have always been filtered through other performers in this city. On Monday night at the Steppenwolf Theatre, she speaks for herself.
Along with trumpeter Lester Bowie and the Ritual Trio, Shange is here at the behest of Kahil El'Zabar, the curator of Steppenwolf's new interdisciplinary performance season (and the Ritual Trio's percussionist). Dubbed "Traffic," the new Monday-night series, which begins with Shange's performance, includes disparate theater artists and writers, musicians of assorted genres, and raconteurs on the level of Studs Terkel.
"When we first developed the idea for a multidisciplinary series, we wanted the `Traffic' pairings to be unusual," says Steppenwolf artistic director Martha Lavey.
El'Zabar (who is also working on the Broadway version of Disney's "The Lion King") does not want to be pinned down on precisely what will happen in the theater on Monday.
"The theme of both the first evening and the whole series is diverse personalities in motion," he says, cryptically. "All of the varied directions and forms of the evening are essential to the artistic whole."
Shange will be reading mainly from her previously published material, fusing the spoken word with Bowie's jazz stylings and the music of the Trio (Ari Brown, Malachi Favors and El'Zabar), with whom the playwright and poet has had a long and complicated relationship. Shange and the Ritual Trio last performed together in the late 1970s at New York's Cafe La Mama.
"Monday will be a night of improvisation," predicts El'Zabar. "There is definitely going to be a lot of special stuff happening."
----------
Lester Bowie, Ntozake Shange and the Ritual Trio perform at 7:30 p.m. Monday as part of the "Traffic" series at the Steppenwolf Theatre, 1650 N. Halsted St. For tickets or more information, call 312-335-1650.

Full text: "Watch Dog": A show that never realizes the considerable potential of its existential theme, David Gilbert's new play, "Watchdog," explores the rough life of a security guard who passes time during the graveyard shift in an office building both fantasizing about his sad dreams of love and recalling a horrible childhood at the hands of an incestuously passionate mother and violent father. The problem with Drew Martin's Chicago Actors Ensemble production is that the poignant central character (well played by Greg Bryant) is obscured by a slew of stereotypical cameos that are so overacted they lose any connection to reality or truth. Gilbert's writing is bold and interesting. But too many blackouts and too much screaming overwhelm a play that should have deftly switched between awkward laughter and pain. At the Mason Hall Theater, 941 W. Lawrence Ave. When: Through Dec. 1. Phone 773-275-4463.

CIRCLE THEATRE OFFERS DIVERSE, EDGY FARE

Author: Chris Jones. Special to the Tribune.

http://turing.library.northwestern.edu/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/291167492?accountid=12861

Abstract: The Circle Theatre in Forest Park is not a typical palace of suburban dramatic entertainment. There are no chandeliers, polished brass or waiters serving dinner. Instead of "Singing in the Rain" or Wayne Newton, this low-budget storefront establishment offers its patrons a diverse but generally nutritious diet of edgy contemporary plays, world premieres by local writers and original musicals with a decidedly camp flavor. Reports of nudity prompted an exploratory visit from a Forest Park police officer, whose written report to the mayor dismissed any suggestion of obscenity and supported the theater and its choice of play. Artistic support sometimes comes from unusual quarters in Forest Park, a municipality that [Karen] Skinner insists is rapidly evolving into a arts-friendly community. Founded in 1985, Circle is probably best known for original works. But the theater has also done full-scale (but cheap) production of operas throughout its 12-year history -- a programming feat without a rival amidst Chicago's fringe theaters. In between gay comedies, a revival of "Hair," and a musical adaptation of "Psycho," Forest Park audiences have also been able to see local productions of "Rigoletto," "La Boheme" and even Gian Carlo Menotti's "The Medium." That's a remarkably eclectic array that would scare away most small companies.

Full text: The Circle Theatre in Forest Park is not a typical palace of suburban dramatic entertainment. There are no chandeliers, polished brass or waiters serving dinner. Instead of "Singing in the Rain" or Wayne Newton, this low-budget storefront establishment offers its patrons a diverse but generally nutritious diet of edgy contemporary plays, world premieres by local writers and original musicals with a decidedly camp flavor.
"We like to give suburban audiences a little more credit than most people do," says Circle's co-founder, Karen Skinner. "Many suburbanites are transplants from large urban areas. They are delighted to find us. They walk in to our theater and say `Thank God, you're here.' "
Just last year, naked actors occupied the tiny and cramped Circle stage during its well-received (and frequently sold-out) production of Brad Fraser's sexually explicit and controversial play, "Unidentified Human Remains and the True Nature of Love."
Reports of nudity prompted an exploratory visit from a Forest Park police officer, whose written report to the mayor dismissed any suggestion of obscenity and supported the theater and its choice of play. Artistic support sometimes comes from unusual quarters in Forest Park, a municipality that Skinner insists is rapidly evolving into a arts-friendly community.
Vietnam veterans turned out in force for Circle's excellent 1995 production of Shirley Lauro's "A Piece of My Heart," propelling the show to considerable success. Directed by Greg Kolack, the drama about women in combat later moved into the city and won a Jeff Citation for outstanding production of the year.
Not every show has been of that quality (ironically, the more commercial titles have tended to be less successfully produced), but the company is slowly gaining momentum and respect in the Chicago theater community.
Founded in 1985, Circle is probably best known for original works. But the theater has also done full-scale (but cheap) production of operas throughout its 12-year history -- a programming feat without a rival amidst Chicago's fringe theaters. In between gay comedies, a revival of "Hair," and a musical adaptation of "Psycho," Forest Park audiences have also been able to see local productions of "Rigoletto," "La Boheme" and even Gian Carlo Menotti's "The Medium." That's a remarkably eclectic array that would scare away most small companies.
"We have never been too concerned about commercial success," says Skinner. "We are much more interested in artistic viability." That said, the theater has always managed to stay in the black somehow. The honorariums may be small and the lobby far from luxurious, but audiences are healthy in size and everyone who works at the theater is paid at least something for their trouble.
Unlike more autocratic artistic leaders, the genial Skinner ensures that Circle runs as an ensemble of creative artists rather than merely an outlet for her own vision. The 1996-97 mainstage season features the work of nine local directors.
This weekend sees the opening of yet another Circle Theatre world premiere. Written by Chicagoan Rebecca Gilman (a resident playwright at Chicago Dramatists' Workshop), "The Glory of Living" is based on the true story of the youngest woman ever sentenced to death row in the United States. The production is directed by Texas transplant Robin Stanton. Best known here for her highly successful production of Ann Noble's powerful Irish drama, "And Neither Have I Wings to Fly," for the Seanachi Theatre Company, Stanton is also managing and resident director at the Dramatists' Workshop.
Stanton says there was "very serious interest" in Gilman's piece (which was partially workshopped at Dramatists') from such big theaters as Steppenwolf and Goodman, but Circle snagged the rights because the company made a generous offer and committed to the project so quickly and with such passion.
"The play is a morality piece about the erosion of innocence," says Stanton. "A young, Southern girl was abandoned as a child and becomes a killer. Rebecca uses that true occurrence to create a subtle but didactic statement that if a society does not raise a child to have respect for human life, its members should not be surprised at murder, gang activity or any of the other horrific things we encounter in our daily lives."
This exploration of the dire consequence of raising a young person badly makes no light evening of theater. "The first scene in particular is a brutal portrait of child abuse," says Stanton. "Overall, this is a very emotionally painful play."
That's exactly the kind of stuff Circle most likes to produce.
"Our sensibilities as artists seemed to match," Skinner says. "So we asked Robin to direct the play here. And she agreed -- even after we had explained our limitations in terms of space and budget."
If past experience can be a guide, Circle's audiences respond well to provocative new work. By now, most people in the neighborhood know what this scruffy, impassioned theater is all about.
"People understand that if they want to see `Oklahoma,' they shouldn't buy a ticket from us," Skinner says. "We like to cater to the explorers."
----------
Rebecca Gilman's "The Glory of Living" opens Friday and plays through Dec. 22 at the Circle Theatre, 7300 W. Madison St., Forest Park. For tickets or more information, call 708-771-0700.

LEAN `PERICLES' TURNS OUT VERY FILLING

Abstract: But thanks to a lean, intelligent and engaging adaptation by Gavin Witt, the low-budget greasy joan Theatre Company reveals that this quixotic play can charm a modern audience. The small studio at Facets Multimedia provides the perfect space for an intimate encounter with the stripped-down Bard. "Pericles, Prince of Tyre" is one of [William] Shakespeare's genre-blending last plays and encapsulates the aging author's mature interest in matters spiritual and temporal. "Time," the play's central monarch remarks in soliloquy, "is the king of men. He is both their parent and their grave."

Full text: Fraught with textual and staging difficulties, William Shakespeare's unwieldy "Pericles" is performed infrequently, even by big classical repertory companies.
But thanks to a lean, intelligent and engaging adaptation by Gavin Witt, the low-budget greasy joan Theatre Company reveals that this quixotic play can charm a modern audience. The small studio at Facets Multimedia provides the perfect space for an intimate encounter with the stripped-down Bard.
"Pericles, Prince of Tyre" is one of Shakespeare's genre-blending last plays and encapsulates the aging author's mature interest in matters spiritual and temporal. "Time," the play's central monarch remarks in soliloquy, "is the king of men. He is both their parent and their grave."
Buffeted by metaphorical and literal seas, King Pericles wanders from country to country, losing a wife to a watery grave and magically rediscovering a long-lost child--the virtue of patience and the wisdom of his age.
Witt, who also directs, pares everything to around two hours. Eight actors play the drama's 20-odd characters. Jana Stauffer's costumes are stylized but contemporary. Replete with netting and sea creatures, Joshua Epstein's simple but lovely set is themed around the play's central idea of exploration.
Not every spoken line is clear, there's some unnecessary shouting and the hard-working Robert McDonough plays Pericles a little too youthfully. But these are minor quibbles. For the most part, everything works together exceptionally well.
Equally at home in the lyrical and comic moments, the ensemble cast turns in some fine performances. Joanne Underwood is a beguiling Marina. Christopher Tiffany and the Wallace Shawn-like Brad Shelton manage to create six highly distinct characters between two actors.
Witt also infuses the openly theatrical show with physical fluidity and a light sense of humor that the previously portentous greasy joan company has sorely needed.
Undaunted by an audience no bigger than the cast, the greasy joan actors danced all over the theater, delivering a difficult but revelatory play with intimacy, understanding and heart.

FOLK DRAMA REMARKABLE POWER AND TALENT BEHIND GLOBE ENSEMBLE

Author: Chris Jones. Special to the Tribune.

http://turing.library.northwestern.edu/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/291163692?accountid=12861

Abstract: Although it's a very recent script, [Sue] Glover's historical folk drama about the agricultural toil of 19th Century women on the farms around the Scottish-English border belongs to the tradition of plays that celebrate female work. The dramatic concerns of the play (sustenance, the sexism of men, the oppression of the landowner, the importance of female bonding) call to mind Caryl Churchill's plays (especially "Fen"), or the musical "Quilters," or even parts of Studs Terkel's "Working."

Full text: With dialects thicker than oatmeal and treacle, an exemplary Shattered Globe cast thrusts itself back into the Scotland of the 1860s for the American premiere of Sue Glover's "Bondagers." The play is not for everyone, but there is no denying the power and talent behind the acting of this remarkable six-woman ensemble.
Although it's a very recent script, Glover's historical folk drama about the agricultural toil of 19th Century women on the farms around the Scottish-English border belongs to the tradition of plays that celebrate female work. The dramatic concerns of the play (sustenance, the sexism of men, the oppression of the landowner, the importance of female bonding) call to mind Caryl Churchill's plays (especially "Fen"), or the musical "Quilters," or even parts of Studs Terkel's "Working."
As she depicts episodes in the lives of these impoverished hired hands, Glover's emphasis is firmly on character. Dramatic vignettes are interwoven with song, dance and poetry. As a result, plotting is a very secondary concern and the understated and sometimes dour drama builds very slowly and lacks moment-by-moment effect or much political bite. Instead, Glover chooses to immerse her audience in a total creative environment, re-creating the lives of these women with painstaking (and arguably excessive) detail.
If the Scots playwright were to see the American acting work here, she could not fail to be delighted. Under Lynn Ann Bernatowicz's careful direction, the young cast delivers truthful work of real poignancy in one of the best ensemble performances of the theatrical year.
The energetic Michele DiMaso (an Off-Loop name to watch) is particularly energetic and compelling as the young and abused Tottie, but the rest of the unified cast (Karin Anglin, Rebecca Jordan, Eileen Niccolai, Robin Margolis and Linda Reiter) are really every bit as good.
Beth Tallon's detailed and authentic costumes provide the perfect complement to the acting work on Todd Reemstma's stark, earth-covered set.
The program provides a much-needed glossary of Scots terminology for those unfamiliar with terms like "bairns" (children) or "hinds" (farm hands). Most of the audience seemed too taken by the acting and the environment to care about how much of the script they understood.

Full text: "Frankly Brendan": An authentic and engaging evening of powerful storytelling from the Emerald Isle, Chris O'Neill's one-person show "Frankly Brendan" interweaves the writings of Irish authors Frank O'Connor and Brendan Behan. Peppering his material with personal anecdote, the eccentric but personable O'Neil devotes most of his intimate two-hour show to O'Connor's enjoyable short stories. While the concerns of the first act are mainly light (O'Connor's young narrator, Jackie, attends his first communion and later discovers the effect of alcohol), the powerful second half of the show concerns the Troubles and the impact guarding two English prisoners has on young IRA soldiers. O'Neill demonstrates that he knows how to balance narrative with theatricality. And he's much more at home with O'Connor and Behan than with Oscar Wilde (his previous subject at the Turnaround). With a shock of curly hair, an enigmatic performance style, and an enviable knowledge of his fellow Irish artists, O'Neill is both an intelligent and a compelling performer. At Turnaround Theatre, 3209 N. Halsted St. Through Dec. 8. Phone 773-296-1100.

"Little Critters": Ellar Wise's 65-minute monologue is inspired by the wildly expressionistic portraits of contemporary painter Jean-Marc Gauthier. It's delivered, manically and movingly, by Scott Rowe who plays Cubby, an armless and legless man in a Catholic half-way home for the disabled. Rowe compassionately depicts these 18 souls who possess just 25 hands among them. Frenetically directed by Kay Cosgriff, Rowe conjures up a Diane Arbus-like world as mordant and hypnotic as Gauthier's kinetic distortions. Thanks to Rowe's fluid and electric performance, by the end Cubby, his wood carvings and his death on a highway matter more than you'd imagine. At Preston Bradley Center, 941 W. Lawrence Ave.; 773-784-0725.

LACHMAN TAKES `FAMILY SECRETS' EVEN HIGHER

Full text: Last year at the Royal-George Theatre, Sherry Glaser attracted large audiences to "Family Secrets," her one-woman, self-penned deconstruction of a dysfunctional Jewish family that just happened to be like her own. So one has to admire the gumption of Donna Blue Lachman, who is audaciously performing Glaser's singularly personal show.
Happily for Apple Tree audiences, Lachman is a consummate theatrical craftsperson, and her version of "Family Secrets" is, in many ways, much better than Glaser's original performance.
As she morphs before the eyes of the audience from Mort (a middle-age accountant) to Bev (his lithium-popping wife) to Molly (his New Age, pseudo-lesbian daughter) to Sandra (Molly's neurotic sister) to Rose (Mort's quirky, aging mother), Glaser's physical transformations are flashy and cleverly crafted. But Lachman's work is far more honest and less reliant on obvious theatrics.
Building on the intimacy of the Apple Tree space, the hard-working Lachman creates characters with real vulnerabilities, forging a warm story-spinning atmosphere with her appreciative audience (many of whom clearly recognized members of their family--or themselves--on stage). This show (co-written by Glaser's husband, Greg Howells) is fiendishly difficult to do well; Lachman's 90-minute solo is a genuine triumph for the longtime Chicago fringe performer.
Lachman cannot, of course, turn "Family Secrets" into great writing. Unlike characters in superior monologue shows tricked by their creators into revelation, Glaser's one-dimensional family members divulge their innermost secrets too readily, without much dramatic reason for their straight-to-the-audience confessions.
Familial relationships, one could argue, are a collection of cultural cliches, with most of our supposed secrets actually similar to those of the family down the block. But the warm heart of this evening comes mainly from the Chicago actress turning placards into people.

ABOUT FACE THEATRE PAINTS `GIFT OF THE MAGI' ON LARGER CANVAS

Full text: "The Gift of the Magi," beloved by readers as a rarity -- a Christmas love story -- is also strong enough to endure a later era's retelling. A premiere by About Face Theatre, "The Gift" is adapter and director Eric Rosen's reworking of O. Henry's sturdy tale as a gay-themed meditation on sacrifice and forgiveness.
In this 75-minute treatment, which was first presented by the Chicago Gay Men's Chorus, the gift-giving takes up only a fifth of the action. Intent on covering a larger canvas, Rosen's scenario depicts two pairs of lovers, one gay and one lesbian, their lives told in flashbacks that connect them spiritually to O. Henry's lovers.
" `The Gift' is about growing up and coming home," Rosen explains. The original couple's bad gift-giving symbolizes the past mistakes that Rosen's two couples made while looking for love. The plot -- actually three stories depicting five characters, including the wise mother of one of the lovers -- offers these modern lovers a second chance at love.
Also new are David Dieckmann's score and Geoffrey M. Curley's set design, which places the action on a giant clock. Ruth Carter and Brian Goodman play characters that are named after O. Henry's Della and Jim, while Millie Hurley, Jean Villepique and Mitchell Fain are the new characters who open up the story to a larger love.
"The Gift" runs through Dec. 29 at Famous Door Theatre, 3212 N. Broadway; 773-404-8283.

HISTORICALLY `VAGUE' MEDIEVAL TIMES ADOPTS ARMOR

Full text: Sitting anachronistically along the Northwest Tollway, the faux-medieval castle of Schaumburg is not a place that suggests an overwhelming concern for historical accuracy.
One imagines going to Medieval Times Dinner and Tournament for free-flowing vittles and hunks on horseback, endless jugs of beer and accommodating serving wenches. Surely no one at that cheerful place of fun and frivolity breaks a sweat over little period details?
Ah but they do. Or at least they did until this weekend.
"Our show has always been set in the 11th Century," says marketing manager Steven S. Davidson. "That's why our knights have always fought in chain mail. Armor was not worn in 1093."
Sadly, that's not what the free-spending suburbanites of today wanteth.
"When people think knights," says the castle's general manager, Leslie Davies, with nary a twinge of the purist's regret, "they think pageantry. They think pomp. They think armor."
Thus, with a little help from Merlin and $250,000 in capital, Medieval Times has re-invented itself. The 11th Century setting has been banished in favor of what Davidson describes as "a more vague medieval time period."
The druid is out (he was from the 6th Century anyway), and a court sorcerer is in (they've been around for centuries). There are new pyrotechnics and special effects, a raft of expensive lighting instruments have been installed amidst the turrets, a high-powered stereo system has fired up, splashy and colorful new costumes adorn the attractive actors . . . and the knights will be jousting in brand new full suits of plate-mail armor.
The new show makes its national debut at 8 p.m. Saturday.
Armor aside, the people at Medieval Times had decided it was time to freshen things up a little anyway.
"After 2,000 performances and 13 years since Medieval Times began in Florida," says Davidson, "we sat down and looked at each and every component of the show. Quite honestly it was outdated for an age when people appreciate pyrotechnics and special effects."
The new look at the Schaumburg Medieval Times is likely to spread across the country during 1997 -- there are six other essentially similar castles in North America, mainly in tourist destinations such as Kissimmee, Fla., and Myrtle Beach, S.C.
"Our location was chosen to debut the new show because we serve a primarily residential market," says Davies. "We rely heavily on repeat business. So we want people to come back a second time and see what we are doing."
Period makeovers aside, the basic concept of the castle is not changing. Audiences will still be served an English-style feast while watching six knights jousting atop Andalusian stallions. Those magnificent (and highly trained) beasts, Davies says, have an even more prominent role in the new script.
Medieval Times continues to sell out its 700 seats here most weekend nights. The new family show was developed even as the local Castle continued to have performances every Wednesday through Sunday.
"We're a cross between dinner-theater and going to the ballgame," says Davies. "We encourage audience involvement. You can let your hair down, swear, shout and get rid of all your inhibitions."

Full text: "Have You Anything to Declare": Temporarily casting aside its growing reputation for weighty drama, the European Repertory theatre company is essaying French sex farce in honor of the holidays. Revolving around an indelicate case of coitus interruptus and the antics of a busy courtesan, "Have You Anything To Declare?" is a generally enjoyable piece of 19th Century nonsense (written by the team of Alfred-Neocles Hennequin and Pierre Venden). This kind of script, though, requires a keenly developed sense of physical comedy. And although this show features a few appropriately broad and very funny performances (Julie Neary and Yasen Peyankov are both excellent), Stephen Ommerle's uneven and insufficiently crafted production lacks visual clarity, cohesive timing and strong relationship with truth. There are a few good laughs but also some long, dry spells. Through Dec. 28 at Baird Hall Theatre, 615 W. Wellington Ave. Phone 773-248-0577.

`GLORY': POWERFUL, DISTURBING

Full text: Thanks to its unflinching exploration of child abuse, sexual deviance and serial murder, Rebecca Gilman's "The Glory of Living" is a graphic and emotionally distressing play that will not raise anyone's holiday spirits.
But this astounding piece of writing from a locally based and hitherto unknown scribe is probably the best new play to emerge this year from the Chicago fringe.
When writing of this quality is combined with a beautifully crafted Circle Theatre production (superbly directed by Robin Stanton), the result is a compelling piece of theater that should not be missed by anyone able to stomach a devastating indictment of the way America raises its children.
"The Glory of Living" is all the more disturbing because of its basis in historical fact. Gilman's central character is a girl named Lisa (Deborah Puette). When we first meet her, this lanky 15-year-old Alabama native is chatting with an older man named Clint (Marty Higginbotham), who is passing the time while his friend has sex with Lisa's prostitute mother behind the blanket that divides their trailer.
Before long, Lisa and Clint are married and embroiled in a pattern of abuse: Lisa is coerced into picking up vagrant teenage girls for Clint's sexual pleasure. Somehow, this horrible man turns his child bride into a murderer and the youngest woman ever to be sentenced to death row.
Unlike other plays of this genre, which sensationalize their villains or ensnare their lower-class characters in Southern stereotype, Gilman tells her story with an almost clinical realism, constantly confounding her audience's expectations.
The authorial message, however, is abundantly clear: We all bear responsibility for young people whose childhoods have been stolen by a society that no longer nurtures its young.
Stanton's production is flawlessly cast. Although Puette's sad and riveting performance in the difficult lead role is the most striking acting work, this is the rare show where even the minor players are startlingly good.
As she proved with last year's "And Neither Have I Wings to Fly," director Stanton knows how to craft powerful stage pictures and provocative transitions. Accompanied by a flickering television set and ever-changing mountains of material debris, "The Glory of Living" tells its terrible story with relentless intensity. This script would stand comparison with the best work of long-established writers. Rebecca Gilman is a name to watch.

WITH `SALOME,' FOOTSTEPS THEATRE CHOOSES WEIGHTY WILDE

Full text: Most theaters planning a little Oscar Wilde for the holidays would pick one of the celebrated 19th Century aesthete's jocular and popular drawing-room comedies, such as "The Importance of Being Earnest."
By contrast, "Salome" (Wilde's dark and complicated treatment of the New Testament story of the young girl who dances and thereby wins the head of John the Baptist), has about as much Christmas spirit as a lump of coal.
But not every December Chicago theatergoer is looking for sleigh bells or a warbling Donny Osmond.
And contemporary theater artists, including England's Steven Berkoff (who presented "Salome" here last year under the auspices of Performing Arts Chicago), have been showing a great deal of interest recently in Wilde's most elusive -- but arguably most revelatory -- drama.
Thus Andersonville's Footsteps Theatre Company is providing a weighty and timely alternative to holiday fluff.
" `Salome' borrows heavily from the pre-Christian world of the Goddess which John's and Jesus' followers appropriated and crushed," says director Dale Heinlen, who says that the new Footsteps production will offer a "less heterosexual Christian and more pagan perspective" on the show.
"We try to demystify the character of John the Baptist," Heinlen says. "We want to bring out both his humanity and his repressed sexuality."
Footsteps promises lush fabrics and highly stylized movement in this woman-centered theater's telling of the dilemmas of Herod's stepdaughter.
Despite her zest for high-concept art, Heinlen still hasn't forgotten the need for a little holiday hype.
"It's an incredibly entertaining show," she maintains, noting that Wilde's work has plenty of bleak comedy.
"People will be moved by the plight of Salome. It's very much a story of unrequited love and our inability to connect with other people."
It sounds like the perfect dark antidote to Dickensian bonhomie.
Salome opens Friday at the Footsteps Theatre, 5230 N. Clark St. For more information, call 773-878 4840.

Full text: The young actors who make up the Free Associates have built a busy literary franchise in the tiny basement of the Ivanhoe Theatre. Depending on the day of the week and the hour of the night, one can see spontaneous spoofs of both detective novels ("Pick-a-Dick") and Shakespeare ("As We Like It"). The original, and best-known, Free Associates show, though, is "Cast On A Hot Tin Roof," a long-form improv designed to spoof the throbbing themes and sultry subtexts of the high priest of Southern gothic angst, Tennessee Williams.
Each Yule, the Free Associates throw some mistletoe and Christmas lights on their venerable old unit set, break out some festive props, and create an instant low-budget holiday show. With the audience cajoled into suggestions appropriate to the season, "A Dysfunctional Dixie Christmas" is essentially "Cast" with tinsel and a few holiday twists.
Southern stereotypes may not be everyone's idea of Christmas levity, but there's plenty of talent amidst the Free Associates--and this troupe has been spoofing Williams since 1991, so they have this genre nailed to the wall like a sprig of holly.
Despite a small crowd and some bizarre audience suggestions, the five-person cast crafted a jolly hourlong romp through the wacky world of Williams with enough intelligent invention and good spirits to warm even a cynic's heart. High-energy standouts amidst a whole troupe of amusing sharp thinkers include Lynda Shadrake and Joe Reilly.
Early next year, the always-busy Free Associates are taking on David Mamet with a new show called "The Scryptogram." Until then, "A Dysfunctional Dixie Christmas" is a dependable and thoroughly enjoyable piece of holiday nonsense.
"Cast On A Hot Tin Roof: A Dysfunctional Dixie Christmas" continues through Dec. 31 at the Ivanhoe Theatre, 750 W. Wellington Ave. Phone 773-795-7171.

A WILDE TIME DESPITE PROBLEMS, INTELLECTUAL `SALOME' WORTH A LOOK

Author: Chris Jones. Special to the Tribune.

http://turing.library.northwestern.edu/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/418253431?accountid=12861

Abstract: Chris Jones reviews a performance of Oscar Wilde's "Salome," directed by Dale Heinen, appearing at the Footsteps Theatre in Chicago through Jan 26, 1997.

Full text: A work atypical of the rest of his jolly canon, Oscar Wilde's "Salome" is a dark and sultry play in which religious figures function as masks for the author's sexual desires. Written late in Wilde's career and devoid of his trademark witty epigrams, this exceptionally difficult piece so upset the English establishment that it was banned in Britain until 1931, due to its controversial depiction of biblical characters. Even since that date, it has been seen rarely.
About a year ago, actor-director Steven Berkoff performed his overtly political adaptation of the drama here under the auspices of Performing Arts Chicago; he turned King Herod and his murderous, dancing daughter into savage indictments of the British leisure classes and John the Baptist into an oppressed revolutionary.
Dale Heinen's intriguing current production at the woman-centered Footsteps Theatre takes a rather different tack: this talented young director focuses on religious and sensual imagery, exploring the ways in which spirituality, sexuality and selfishness all collide when Salome (Tere Parkes) fails to get her way. Heinen locates Herod (David Parkes) and his court in a clearly pagan environment, emphasizing the characters' fears of the unknown. She is unafraid to explore John the Baptist's hidden sensuality, suggesting the prophet (David Mitchell Ghilardi) has deeply repressed his own physical desires.
Every aspect of this ambitious production does not work. There is some inconsistent switching between stylized movement and realistic acting; much of the play's thinly veiled humor is overwhelmed by the concept; and many of the minor players seem to disappear into the walls of the theater by the end of the 90-minute show.
But none of these problems should deter audiences interested in an intelligent and powerful production of Wilde's most revelatory work, especially because the husband-and-wife team of lead performers is exceptionally strong. Tere Parkes' Dance of the Seven Veils is alluringly sensual while David Parkes' unusually sympathetic Herod avoids cliche and gives body to a complicated and troubled figure. Dawn Alden offers strident support as Herodias, Herod's wife.
Most important, there are strong ideas being played out on Footsteps' tiny stage, turned into a wonderfully dark, blustery and enveloping environment by set designer Joe Jensen. Wilde would have approved of Footsteps' intellectual and sexual freedom.

Abstract: Chris Jones discusses the theatrical series "Naked i--A Feast for the Senses" at Chicago's Bailiwick Arts Center running Jan 7-Feb 9, 1997.

Links: http://hopper.library.northwestern.edu/sfx?genre=article&amp;sid=ProQ:&amp;atitle=WORDS%2C+WORDS%2C+WORDS%3A+%60NAKED+I%27+TAKES+ANOTHER+TACK&amp;title=Chicago+Tribune&amp;issn=10856706&amp;date=1997-01-03&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=4&amp;pid=Jones%2C+Chris

Full text: Most of the theater one finds in Chicago these days is driven by text. In other words, the play is almost always the primary thing, with all of the other creative work on stage serving the needs of the lines in the script.
For years, of course, some artists and theorists have argued that too much talk can undermine the excitement of the other aspects of theater -- especially its visceral and visual appeal. Hence "Naked i" at the Bailiwick. Subtitled "A Feast for the Senses," this new monthlong series features visually based performance pieces that are as free as possible from spoken language.
"I always wanted to have a festival that would challenge the artist to work with less text," says Bailiwick artistic director Cecilie Keenan. "If words are not the primary means of communication, that opens up possibilities of soundscape and movement and energy. And it can help audiences connect with stronger images."
Keenan has engaged Jonathan Pitts (curator of the theater and performance art section of the Around the Coyote festival) to put together a different group of performances each week.
The series begins Tuesday with (minimally textual) works by Bryn Magnus, Patrick McNulty and Robert Schliefer. Some of Chicago's best-known performance artists show up on future schedules: Danny Thompson; members of Red Moon Theatre; Ann Boyd; and Greg Allen.
Keenan says that the rules of "Naked i" have prompted some participants to think about their performance work in new ways. "We have a lighting designer (John Musial) and a sculptor (Charlie Levin) on the schedule," she says. "Other performers have been primarily known until now for their use of words.
"Everyone in `Naked i' is being challenged to work with a different side of their creativity."
----------
"Naked i -- A Feast for the Senses" begins Tuesday at the Bailiwick Arts Center, 1229 W. Belmont Ave. There is a different program each week through Feb. 9. Call 773-883-1090.

`ICE-FISHING PLAY' PONDERS BIG QUESTIONS, MIDWEST STYLE

Author: Jones, Chris

http://turing.library.northwestern.edu/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/418214068?accountid=12861

Abstract: Kevin Kling's "The Ice-Fishing Play," scheduled to be performed at Evanston IL's Next Theatre beginning Jan 17, 1997, is discussed.

Links: http://hopper.library.northwestern.edu/sfx?genre=article&amp;sid=ProQ:&amp;atitle=%60ICE-FISHING+PLAY%27+PONDERS+BIG+QUESTIONS%2C+MIDWEST+STYLE&amp;title=Chicago+Tribune&amp;issn=10856706&amp;date=1997-01-10&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=4&amp;pid=Jones%2C+Chris

Full text: Perhaps playwrights and filmmakers are fascinated by the way a cold climate nurtures Scandinavian stoicism, but the State of Minnesota is fast becoming the location of choice when contemporary artists want to gently deconstruct Midwestern life.
The Coen Brothers' film "Fargo" explored the quiet wisdom of rural eccentrics. And Kevin Kling's "The Ice-Fishing Play" tells the story of a fellow named Ron who ponders tricky existential questions while sitting in an ice-fishing shack on a frozen Minnesota lake and experiencing strange visitations from people in his past.
Premiered to positive reviews at the Actors Theatre of Louisville in 1993, this homespun drama by the author of "Lloyd's Prayer" begins performances Friday at Evanston's Next Theatre.
Unlike the Hollywood interlopers, Kling actually lives and works in Minneapolis. And guest director Doug Finlayson says that the author's experience enhances the truth of this bleakly comic play.
"Kevin is very much a part of the world he is writing about," Finlayson says. "This is a very funny piece but also a very personal one."
Although he now lives in Tucson, Finlayson spent 12 years in Chicago; he was associate artistic director of the late, lamented Wisdom Bridge Theatre for much of the 1980s. Finlayson's production of Emily Mann's "Execution of Justice" at the Bailiwick Repertory Theatre in 1987 featured the acting talents of Steve Pickering, now artistic director of Next. Pickering invited Finlayson back, and the two decided to cast Next managing director Peter Rybolt as the lead character.
It's a heavy role touched by the poignant humor of the eccentrics who appear to the lonely fisherman amid the ice.
"The main character discovers that if you fail to adjust to the way the world changes, you're doomed," Finlayson says.
----------
"The Ice-Fishing Play" begins previews Friday and opens on Jan. 14 at the Next Theatre, 927 Noyes St., Evanston. For more information, call 847-475-1875.

`FUR' DOES A DARKLY COMIC TAKE ON `BEAUTY AND THE BEAST'

Author: Jones, Chris

http://turing.library.northwestern.edu/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/418263366?accountid=12861

Abstract: Playwright Migdalia Cruz's darkly comic play "Fur," a retelling of "Beauty and the Beast," became a critical success in 1995 at Latino Chicago in Bucktown, but was seen by relatively few people. The weekend of Jan 17, 1997, Cruz's work seeks out new and bigger audiences when "Fur" reopens as part of Chicago's Steppenwolf Studio Series.

Links: http://hopper.library.northwestern.edu/sfx?genre=article&amp;sid=ProQ:&amp;atitle=%60FUR%27+DOES+A+DARKLY+COMIC+TAKE+ON+%60BEAUTY+AND+THE+BEAST%27&amp;title=Chicago+Tribune&amp;issn=10856706&amp;date=1997-01-17&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=4&amp;pid=Jones%2C+Chris

Full text: Playwright Migdalia Cruz was attending a writers' conference in California a few years ago when she suddenly sank into a state of depression.
"I looked at the people in the room," Cruz remembers, "and I noticed some were beautiful and some were not.
"That started me thinking about the nature of infatuation and longing and what happens when you fall in love with the wrong person who does not return your feelings."
The result of that contemplative experience was "Fur," a dark but fanciful retelling of "Beauty and the Beast," in which a pet-store owner, a somewhat bestial sideshow oddity and an animal trapper all become ensnared in a quixotic love triangle in which the pursuit of passion produces as much pain as pleasure.
This darkly comic play became a critical success two years ago at Latino Chicago in Bucktown, but was seen by relatively few people.
This weekend, Cruz's work seeks out new and bigger audiences when "Fur" reopens as part of the Steppenwolf Studio Series. Ralph Flores directs.
"The bigger space at Steppenwolf seems to emphasize the despair of the piece and the depth of the characters' longings," Cruz says.
"At Latino Chicago, the production seemed intimate. At Steppenwolf, it's as if the audience is entering an enormous womb."
Currently dividing her time between New York and Chicago, Cruz is quickly becoming a significant national dramatic voice.
Aside from her local work with Latino Chicago, she's under commission from New York's Public Theatre to write a Puerto Rican history play.
"Fur" has upcoming productions scheduled in California. And her latest play, "Salt" (about child prostitution), is being developed as a screenplay at the Sundance Institute Screenwriting Workshop in Utah.
"Migdalia writes from a woman's perspective but she has a language all of her own," says Anna Shapiro, who heads Steppenwolf's New Plays Laboratory.
"There's both brutality and beauty at the heart of her work."

Full text: "Pericles": A motley mix of young performers and community character actors, Shakespeare's Gale Force collectively throws itself at "Pericles" with so much enthusiasm that the production seems about to burst out of the tiny Organic Greenhouse. Even though the size of the cast can outnumber the audience, the enigmatic Rolfe Sanberg Jr. plays the wandering Prince of Tyre with such emotional intensity that it seems like this role is the fulfillment of a lifelong dream. There is something so beguiling about Shakespeare played with obvious love by such a passionate group of actors that one forgives that this show is really pretty terrible. With an amateurish set, costumes looking like rejects from "A Funny Thing Happened on the Way to the Forum" and precious little classical technique, there's no sense here of the play's fanciful language or theatrical whimsy. Nor is there evidence of any clear directorial idea from Tim Goldich. All that's offered is a raw desire to speak Shakespeare; there are worse sins. Through Feb. 2 at Organic Theatre Greenhouse, 3319 N. Clark St. Phone 773-327-5588.

`PLAY IT AGAIN, SAM' SHOWS ITS AGE

http://turing.library.northwestern.edu/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/418287029?accountid=12861

Abstract: Chris Jones reviews a performance of "Play It Again, Sam," directed by David Mink, showing at the Drury Lane Theatre in Evergreen Park IL through Mar 9, 1997.

Links: http://hopper.library.northwestern.edu/sfx?genre=article&amp;sid=ProQ:&amp;atitle=%60PLAY+IT+AGAIN%2C+SAM%27+SHOWS+ITS+AGE&amp;title=Chicago+Tribune&amp;issn=10856706&amp;date=1997-01-23&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=2&amp;pid=Chris+Jones.+Special+to+the+Tribune.

Full text: Unless you are the bespectacled neurotic New Yorker himself, it's not much fun playing the central character in a play by Woody Allen.
Allen Felix, the lovable writer/loser at the heart of the 1969 Broadway comedy "Play It Again Sam," is well-endowed with those Allenesque dilemmas that have lost much of their innocence in the intervening years. His bored wife has left him. Other women reject his awkward attempts at seduction. Retreating into fantasy, he imagines lessons in love from Humphrey Bogart. Ultimately, of course, the smartest and most beautiful woman around (played originally by Diane Keaton) is seduced by his brains, charm and vulnerability. Such are Allen's now-familiar dramatic fantasies.
The Drury Lane Theatre in Evergreen Park does not, of course, have Allen's acting services. Instead, it has JoBe Cerny, best known for his silent performances in a long-running laundry detergent commercial. Here forced to speak, Cerny finds the whine but not the truth in the Allen alter-ego, delivering a barrage of flat line readings and repetitive speech rhythms.
Happily, Kathy Santen is on hand as Linda, the married friend who finds Felix irresistible. Santen works her considerable talent like crazy, but with the awkward Cerny killing the punchlines, it's not much use. The remainder of the cast consists of women (Kelley Hazen, Julie Ann Emery, Gail Rastorfer) forced to play a variety of stereotypes; they all do the best they can. What few laughs there are come mainly from James McCance's mealy-mouthed Bogey, with Sean Grennan cheerfully rounding out the ensemble as the married businessman who neglects his wife.
Director David Mink has developed a troubling habit of updating plays from another time. Added references to Microsoft, Al Gore and Jack Kevorkian are only anachronistic in a play that clearly belongs to an era when divorce was rarer, cocktails flowed more freely and sexism was funny. There's a market for revivals of old Broadway fare, but one might as well be honest.

Full text: Dream Street Theatre: Downtown Blue Island now boasts a beautiful new performance venue, thanks to the efforts of the Dream Street Theatre. Located in a renovated old movie theater, this new for-profit venture is the brainchild of three area residents (Barry Wolk, Daniel Griffin and Glenn Hering), known collectively as Glenbardan Inc. The large facility is indeed impressive; audiences can choose either auditorium seating or cabaret-style tables with waitress service. There's an elegant lobby, full bar, a big thrust stage with all the technical trappings and a palpable wish to please the customer. Now halfway through its debut season under executive director Wayne Adams, the professional Dream Street is offering a diet of small musicals and commercial plays, using a mix of Chicago and local talent.
Currently on offer is Alden Nowlen and Walter Lemming's Sherlock Holmes mystery, "The Incredible Murder of Cardinal Tosca." It's a witty and intelligent script, but the plot is convoluted and rather darker than much of the audience seemed to be expecting. Still, Richard Helweg's ambitious production is solid, especially for a new company. Some of the younger actors are overly broad and the second-act climax lacks focus, but Joe Falocco is an appropriately erudite Holmes, supported by Tom Cassidy's earnest Dr. Watson. Most importantly, there are enough visual thrills and honest performances on display to keep those necessary audiences returning and paying the bills. Through Sunday at 12952 S. Western Ave. Phone 708-371-5151.

AN OLD WARHORSE AFTER ALL THESE YEARS, `STALAG 17' STILL HAS LEGS

Author: Chris Jones. Special to the Tribune.

Abstract: Additional material published Feb. 5, 1997: Corrections and clarifications. A review of the play "Stalag 17" at American Blues Theatre in today's preprinted Tempo section incorrectly identifies the actor who played the role of Sefton. The correct actor is Robert Maffia. The Tribune regrets the error. When "Stalag 17" won the Tony Award for best Broadway play some half-century ago, American audiences liked their dramas to be realistic and structured around a well-defined and easily understood plot. Set in the barracks of a German prison camp, this World War II show by Donald Bevan and Edmund Trzcinski (themselves former POWs) is the very model of the well-made commercial play. Since "Stalag 17" is the sire of television army comedy like "M*A*S*H," "The Phil Silvers Show" and, specifically, "Hogan's Heroes," most people probably remember the play's comedic elements -- the ethnic gags, the German-baiting, the practical joking. But Louis Contey's energetic revival of this old warhorse for Harvest Productions at American Blues Theatre tends to downplay the humor in favor of this talented young director's trademark pot-boiling realism -- Marty Higginbotham, for example, plays the German stooge Shultz as an earnest (even emotional) fellow, rather than the familiar figure of fun.

When "Stalag 17" won the Tony Award for best Broadway play some half-century ago, American audiences liked their dramas to be realistic and structured around a well-defined and easily understood plot. Set in the barracks of a German prison camp, this World War II show by Donald Bevan and Edmund Trzcinski (themselves former POWs) is the very model of the well-made commercial play.
There's one, unchanging setting. The big cast of characters functions as a microcosm of American diversity; the prisoners include representatives from every European immigrant group and level of income (except that they are all male and all white). The action revolves around two central narrative questions: Which prisoner is a Nazi informant? And what will the friends he has betrayed decide to do about it?
Since "Stalag 17" is the sire of television army comedy like "M*A*S*H," "The Phil Silvers Show" and, specifically, "Hogan's Heroes," most people probably remember the play's comedic elements -- the ethnic gags, the German-baiting, the practical joking.

If the comedy is not always successful, Contey has assembled a strong, young cast who throw themselves into the play's macho shenanigans with real zest. No one is still for a moment as the action uses every inch of Luke Cantarella's hugely impressive setting (if only other Off-Loop companies committed to this high level of theatrical design). Standouts amid the uniformly competent cast include Tom Fiscella, whose troubled Boston bad boy seems to have stepped right out of a film noir, the powerful acting work of Doug McDade (Hoffman) and the nicely understated Tom Geraty in the role of the prisoner whom war has sent mad.
Even though the play flirts with issues of wartime morality and the role of democracy in crisis, this faithful production settles for re-creating the period essence of "Stalag 17." This is fundamentally a celebration of male relationships and a rattling good yarn.

MOTLEY CREW SHOEHORNS `KING JOHN' INTO ONYX THEATRE

Author: Jones, Chris

http://turing.library.northwestern.edu/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/418298076?accountid=12861

Abstract: Shakespeare's Motley Crew has been wanting to produce the Bard's "The Life and Death of King John" for nearly three years, but the itinerant troupe knows the importance of finding the right person to take creative charge. Finally, J.R. Sullivan (the Crew's director of choice) has a free spot in his busy schedule. The former artistic director of the New American Theatre in Rockford, Sullivan has become one of the most sought-after freelancers in town -- he cemented his reputation with a widely acclaimed 1995 production of "Faith Healer" at the Turnaround Theatre. Often overshadowed by the bigger and better-known Shakespeare Repertory Theatre, the non-Equity Shakespeare's Motley Crew has nonetheless carved out a solid reputation as an energetic producer of classical theater (at just about every tiny rental venue in town) during the last five years.

Full text: Shakespeare's Motley Crew has been wanting to produce the Bard's "The Life and Death of King John" for nearly three years, but the itinerant troupe knows the importance of finding the right person to take creative charge.
"You do a show like this with the wrong director," says Crew founding member David Macknin, "and the show is a disaster." So the company has waited. And waited.
Finally, J.R. Sullivan (the Crew's director of choice) has a free spot in his busy schedule. The former artistic director of the New American Theatre in Rockford, Sullivan has become one of the most sought-after freelancers in town -- he cemented his reputation with a widely acclaimed 1995 production of "Faith Healer" at the Turnaround Theatre.
Sullivan says he is excited to be producing one of Shakespeare's most potent political dramas, even though the site of the play, the Onyx Theatre, is barely big enough to hold the large cast, let alone the audience.
Often overshadowed by the bigger and better-known Shakespeare Repertory Theatre, the non-Equity Shakespeare's Motley Crew has nonetheless carved out a solid reputation as an energetic producer of classical theater (at just about every tiny rental venue in town) during the last five years.
The Crew's outreach program is also well known; this summer's production of "The Taming of the Shrew" will be showing up all over Chicagoland, including a series of free outdoor performances at the Wallace Bowl Amphitheater in Wilmette. "We put our shows up on a wagon and drag ourselves around," says the enthusiastic Macknin.
That's the summer. The winter is a time for darker but timeless theatrical themes, and Sullivan is happy to oblige.
"Most of the characters in this play are prepared to turn on a dime for political gain," Sullivan says of "King John." "That certainly resonates in our own century.
"Just like so many people today," says the busy director, "the characters in `King John' are always asking, `What's in this for me?' "

`DO LORD' STIRS CHICAGO THEATRE COMPANY

Author: Chris Jones. Special to the Tribune.

http://turing.library.northwestern.edu/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/418306149?accountid=12861

Abstract: Douglas Alan-Mann was sitting reading a copy of "Do Lord Remember Me," a show about the memories of former slaves, when one particular story stopped the artistic director of the Chicago Theatre Company right in his tracks. "One character relates a story about what happened to her while working in the big house," he remembers. "She tells of how she is punished and how the punishment scars her for life. I realized she was talking about the horror of how human beings can treat other human beings. And I decided we had to produce this play as a tribute to Black History Month." James de Jongh's play is actually a mix of music, dance and oral history drawn from a series of interviews with elderly former slaves conducted in Virginia for the Works Progress Administration in the 1930s. Initially produced by New York's New Federal Theatre in the early 1980s (and revived there just this year), "Do Lord Remember Me" contains narrative memories, movement, and spirituals.

Full text: Douglas Alan-Mann was sitting reading a copy of "Do Lord Remember Me," a show about the memories of former slaves, when one particular story stopped the artistic director of the Chicago Theatre Company right in his tracks.
"One character relates a story about what happened to her while working in the big house," he remembers. "She tells of how she is punished and how the punishment scars her for life. I realized she was talking about the horror of how human beings can treat other human beings. And I decided we had to produce this play as a tribute to Black History Month."
James de Jongh's play is actually a mix of music, dance and oral history drawn from a series of interviews with elderly former slaves conducted in Virginia for the Works Progress Administration in the 1930s. Initially produced by New York's New Federal Theatre in the early 1980s (and revived there just this year), "Do Lord Remember Me" contains narrative memories, movement, and spirituals.
Five performers play the former slaves at various stages in their lives. The work has never been given a major production in Chicago.
The show's director, Lisa Duncan (who's also the artistic director of Edgewater's Chameleon Productions), says that the appeal of the piece lies mainly in its unflinching authenticity.
"All of the words in the play come from the former slaves themselves," Duncan says. "I think slavery is a legacy that must be continually explored. We all need to better understand a peculiar institution that continues to leave its mark on society.
"As one character explains, these folk had seen plenty of slavery taking place after Lincoln had freed the slaves."
Despite the hardships behind all of the lives on theatrical display, Duncan argues the message of the piece is ultimately one of empowerment.
"You have to be able to draw from the strengths of people who were able to survive," she says. "They left a wonderful legacy despite the cruelty."
The Chicago Theatre Company (CTC) is certainly a logical home for "Do Lord Remember Me." The only African-American theater on the South Side with an ongoing agreement with Actor's Equity (it operates under a well-paying contract and enjoys an annual budget in excess of $200,000), CTC offers a creative home for African-American union performers who want to make a decent salary from their performance work.
"So many of our people have to go to New York to make a living," says Alan-Mann. "But the talent pool here is very deep. And we tend to get very, very lucky with the people who want to work with us."
This season attendance has been up some 25 percent from the previous year, with the company attracting a significant segment of its audience from the suburbs, as well as visitors to the area hailing from all over the country.

`OTIS REDDING STORY' IS QUITE THE PARTY

Author: Chris Jones. Special to the Tribune.

http://turing.library.northwestern.edu/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/418309242?accountid=12861

Abstract: In "The Otis Redding Story," Jackie Taylor and Jimmy Tillman celebrate the life of the oft-neglected soul great who died in a plane crash at the age of 26, just before he could enjoy the fruits of his biggest hit, "Sitting On The Dock of the Bay." There's just enough narrative to remind the crowd that Redding (Vince Harris) was highly influential in the international popularization of soul music and to note that he overcame serious racial barriers in his rise from Macon, Ga., while remaining generous of spirit and loyal to his wife (Nicole L. Tinnin) and friends. There's no interest here in scandal, images of excess, or scenes of prejudice that make anyone (of any race) uncomfortable. That's not the Black Ensemble Theatre's style. As the narrative figure of Magic Man (the enigmatic Rick Stone) tells the audience, "this ain't no talk show, this is a tribute." It's quite a party. In less than two hours and with impressive authenticity, the soulful Harris belts out close to 30 of Redding's songs, including such greats as "Mr. Pitiful," and "These Arms of Mine," all backed by a seven-piece live band: there's even a high-energy Redding version of "I Can't Get No (Satisfaction)" that had this Beacon Street joint jumping.

Full text: The great achievement of Jackie Taylor and Jimmy Tillman's ongoing series of African-American musical biographies is that these uplifting revues combine the lessons of history with enough singing and dancing to chase away the blues of the longest work-week.
In "The Otis Redding Story," Taylor and Tillman celebrate the life of the oft-neglected soul great who died in a plane crash at the age of 26, just before he could enjoy the fruits of his biggest hit, "Sitting On The Dock of the Bay."
There's just enough narrative to remind the crowd that Redding (Vince Harris) was highly influential in the international popularization of soul music and to note that he overcame serious racial barriers in his rise from Macon, Ga., while remaining generous of spirit and loyal to his wife (Nicole L. Tinnin) and friends. There's no interest here in scandal, images of excess, or scenes of prejudice that make anyone (of any race) uncomfortable. That's not the Black Ensemble Theatre's style. As the narrative figure of Magic Man (the enigmatic Rick Stone) tells the audience, "this ain't no talk show, this is a tribute."
It's quite a party. In less than two hours and with impressive authenticity, the soulful Harris belts out close to 30 of Redding's songs, including such greats as "Mr. Pitiful," and "These Arms of Mine," all backed by a seven-piece live band: there's even a high-energy Redding version of "I Can't Get No (Satisfaction)" that had this Beacon Street joint jumping.
Lest a whole night of Redding become too much, the ensemble also performs numbers popularized by other musicians of the era: LaVondra Hinton wails the Aretha Franklin version of "Respect," while other impersonations include Sam and Dave, Joe Tex and Carla Thomas, the Queen of Memphis Soul.
Production values are minimal and the book has its rough spots, but the pace of this high-energy show never sags. And Taylor has found some real talent amidst her committed young cast of excellent singers, including Tony Malone, Chester M. Gregory, Johnny Wilson, Barbara Cannon and Nikita Harris.
Wilson and Tillman found commercial success with "Doo Wop Bop Shop." Judging by the excitement of an audience that was singing the first lines of most songs before the band had finished the introductions, a souped-up commercial production of "Try A Little Tenderness" would likely draw big and happily multiracial crowds.

LESS IS MORE FOR THE SOUL , THEO UBIQUE TROUPE BELIEVES

Full text: Most impoverished fringe companies producing theater in tiny venues hope to one day occupy a larger space and perform to a bigger audience -- if only someone will help pay the rent. Such vital dreams keep them in the business.
Fred Anzevino and his new Theo Ubique Theatre Company are delighted to be performing at the Heartland Studio Theatre, a space barely larger than the closet of a suburban home. Anzevino, 40, hates the commercial theater and all its trappings. He disdains show-business hyperbole and claims no interest in making money or merely entertaining. For Anzevino, playmaking is a serious -- even a transcendent -- activity.
"Theater heals through honesty, concentration, simplicity, awe," he says, with nary a touch of irony. "If one can evoke elements of the spiritual on stage, it can heal all people."
With that goal in mind, Anzevino founded Theo Ubique (a Greek-Latin hybrid meaning "God present in everything") after taking several years away from his fieldbecause he was depressed by what he saw as the theater's increasingly venal interest in commerce. For his troupe's first production, the director-producer has selected Ugo Betti's "Crime on Goat Island," an obscure and avowedly intellectual piece about a group of people who move to a small island inhabited only by bleating, bearded mammals.
"All of Betti's characters have hit rock-bottom," Anzevino says, describing the Kafkaesque Italian play from 1946. "They are all at the lowest points of their lives and struggling from all of their pain and suffering and trying to heal themselves. This is definitely a spiritual play."
It hardly sounds like a box-office smash, but that's missing Anzevino's point. He doesn't want very many people there anyway.
"The larger the theater gets, the more external problems there are and the more difficult it becomes for honesty to appear," he says. "Spiritual and holy theater can only be performed in small and dingy spaces."

TAYLOR ' S WORK TAKES A NON - WRITING TURN

Author: Chris Jones. Special to the Tribune.

Full text: Very few new directors have the chance to make their debut on one of the Goodman Theatre's stages -- it's hardly a place one associates with beginners. Then again, very few new directors come with the resume of Regina Taylor.
An electric and eclectic talent equally at home producing avant-garde live performance work and appearing in commercial movies and television, Taylor's face is best known to the public for her featured roles in films like "Courage Under Fire" (she played opposite Denzel Washington), "Losing Isaiah" and "A Family Thing." She also won a Golden Globe for her work as Lily Harper in the highly acclaimed television series "I'll Fly Away," set during the civil rights movement. Beginning next month, Taylor, 34, will show up again in a central role on network television, playing a U.S. attorney in the new CBS series "F.E.D.s."
The commercial acting is what pays her Manhattan rent. But Taylor's past work as an artistic associate at the Goodman has focused on her own writing, prompting comparisons to the celebrated monologuist Anna Deveare Smith.
Last season, Taylor enjoyed positive reviews for her surreal one-woman travelogue, "Escape From Paradise," in which she depicted 10 characters in less than 90 minutes as part of a young woman's journey from Venice, Calif., to Venice, Italy. In 1994, the Goodman presented two of her short plays, "Watermelon Rinds" (about an allegorical black family) and "Inside the Belly of the Beast" (about a black man's struggles against the evils of corporate America), under the umbrella title "The Ties That Bind."
Taylor's writing is very well regarded. "She is an important and prolific playwright," says Jackie Taylor, artistic director of Chicago's Black Ensemble Theatre and an enthusiastic admirer. "Regina's work is always enlightening."
So this year's selection in what has become the annual Regina Taylor slot in the Goodman Studio Theatre's series is something of a surprise. Instead of showcasing Taylor's own writing, "Transformations" is a collection of five, short, one-act plays by mainly well-known playwrights, all written shortly before or after 1970. In her role as curator of the production, Taylor selected the plays and will direct one herself. (It opens Monday.)
The lineup comprises Peter Handke's "Prophecy" (directed here by Marianne Kim), Adrienne Kennedy's "The Owl Answers" (directed by Susan V. Booth), Maria Irene Fornes' "Dr. Kheal" (directed by Taylor), Sam Shepard's "Red Cross" (directed by Henry Godinez) and Oliver Pitcher's "The One" (directed by Cheryl Lynn Bruce).
A sixth piece, by Ed Bullins (the show was originally billed as "Transformations 6"), was later dropped from the evening, apparently due to time constraints.
So why produce a group of old and obscure one-acts by writers who, on the surface, seem to have very little in common?
"All of these writers explore the role of language as a tool to define our universe," Taylor says, noting that she considered more than 100 plays before arriving at her final choice. "They show how words can be used to build our safe little worlds and how language can be either empowering or dictatorial."
The scribes selected by Taylor are all well known for their disdain for conventional narrative and love of the meta-theatrical. None of these short plays (together they take about 2 1/2 hours to perform) inhabits anything close to a realistic universe. In the Kennedy piece, for example, the subway setting soon becomes the Tower of London and then a Harlem hotel room. And the central character has the twin identity of the Virgin Mary and an owl.
"The play is about the labels people put on us," says Booth, its director (and Goodman dramaturge). "It's about our need to forge our own identity as the possessor of our own history."
Taylor says she intends the evening to function as a unified whole, even though it's made up of works by different authors. The same six actors (Tab Baker, Ora Jones, Darryl Alan Reed and Raun Ruffin join Bruce and Godinez on stage) reappear in the several pieces and the division of the multiple roles has been carefully planned.
"The evening is really a series of boxes," Taylor says. "You have six nameless actors in the first box. In the second, there are character names. Even though the performers have different names at times, we are always following the essence of their characters. And the journey of the individual."
Taylor's previous Goodman work has often explored the nature of racial identity, and the eclectic ethnicities of the artists and writers involved in this project suggest some interesting and unusual connections (there have been reports of a lively dialogue during the artistic process, especially surrounding the dropped Bullins piece).
For example, Booth, a white director, is directing Kennedy, an African-American writer very concerned with self-determination. The director acknowledges that "everybody brings their own culture to the table," but says she also connects to the play "as a woman seeking her own identity."
"The evening is about the transformation of the human spirit," Booth says. "And that's not the province of one color."
Such challenges are typical for anyone working with Taylor, who has never shied away from controversy or the exploration of difference.
"I am interested in how we construct our lives," Taylor says, with her typical warm intensity. "Do we have a choice in leaving our boxes? Or do we prefer to just be pushed from one place to another?"

BRIDESMAIDS TAKE THE CAKE IN WITTY, FRESH `FIVE WOMEN'

Author: Chris Jones. Special to the Tribune.

http://turing.library.northwestern.edu/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/418270974?accountid=12861

Abstract: Many people, especially single people, hate weddings. Aside from the absurd rituals, the booze-soaked speeches and the dangerous intergenerational mingling, the sight of a friend finally settling down invariably sparks neuroses. With regrets and insecurities flowing like bad champagne, guests at weddings often do things they later regret. That's the fertile comic environment of Alan Ball's "Five Women Wearing the Same Dress," a witty and commercial comedy on engagement at Circle Theatre. Set in the bedroom of an upscale Knoxville home during a wedding, Ball's contemporary play follows the familiar formula of placing disparate characters (here, bridesmaids taking refuge) in a closed environment at a time of stress. The dramatic types are very familiar. Meredith (Bethanny Alexander) is the bride's rebellious little sister, a college graduate tired of living in her sibling's shadow. Georgeanne (Ann Followill) worries about men and her weight. Trisha (Janelle Rienstra Snow) finds that her past promiscuity is growing dull now that she's 32. Ball also throws a fundamentalist Christian, Frances (Seema Sueko) and a self-assured lesbian, Mindy (Siobhan Sullivan) into his comic mix. A man named Tripp (Jeff Charlton) makes a brief appearance at the end, but the play belongs to the women wearing the same pink dress.

A man named Tripp (Jeff Charlton) makes a brief appearance at the end, but the play belongs to the women wearing the same pink dress.
Anyone familiar with, say, "Four Weddings and a Funeral" or "Steel Magnolias" could easily predict what happens.
So why is Ball's formulaic 1993 play also fresh and entertaining? Probably because the author has a palpable affection for the bad Southern belle and injects his boozing and drug-taking creations with a healthy disrespect for their place in the world. There are many wicked one-liners that had the Circle audience in stitches.
Director Greg Kolack makes a specialty of these female ensemble pieces and he knows how to meld a vivacious but truthful ensemble. Not all of the casting is perfect in this well-paced production, but there are compelling comic performances from Snow and Alexander.
Perhaps Circle will be able to keep this crowd-pleaser running through the spring and peak wedding season. It's a great choice for bachelorette parties.

Full text: "Luv": There's nothing lovely about love: We all gotta have it--and we'll do just about anything to get it, especially if it means lying, cheating and stealing. Such is the premise of Maury Schisgal's "Luv" by Fourth Wall Productions. Marzena Szajer-Bukowska, David Booth and Reid Ostrowski play three points of a triangle who break up, make up, divorce, marry, divorce, marry, make love, make war, contemplate suicide, plot murder, and whine, whine, whine--all in the name of that four-letter word. "Luv" is a cynic's delight with snappy one-liners and some good-naturedly over-the-top performances. See this one after the breakup--or before the wedding. It makes celibacy look like a smart career move. Through March 15 at Fourth Wall Productions, Wright College, 4300 N. Narragansett Ave. Phone 773-481-8535.

Cibo Matto: The appeal of Cibo Matto, two Japanese women who play a jazzy blend of hip-hop and pop, has always depended more on cultural juxtaposition than on technical proficiency, but at its Metro show Friday night, the duo's musical ambitions exceeded its limited abilities. Instead of the charming, Beck-ish mishmash of rap and rock displayed in its recordings to date, the duo, backed by an amateurish rhythm section, subjected the audience to ponderous, prog-rock versions of nonsense songs like "Birthday Cake" and "Know Your Chicken." If Cibo Matto would stuck to chanting quirky lyrics over skittery breakbeats instead of offering perfunctory, pseudo-punk versions of its ephemeral songs, perhaps the duo's deficiencies wouldn't have seemed quite so glaring.
-- Mo Ryan
"Iphigenia": Ellen McLaughlin's interesting feminist take on the Oresteia, titled "Iphigenia and Other Daughters," tells the usually male-dominated story of the ill-fated House of Atreus from a womanly perspective. This three-part, 90-minute revisionist adaptation removes the legendary Greek women from their original classical milieu and places them in a 20th Century environment somewhere around World War I. At times it seems as if McLaughlin cannot decide whether she is updating the original texts with anachronistic references or setting them in the kind of timeless theatrical environment that's common with contemporary treatments of Greek drama. Still, there are some compelling images floating around the Griffin Theatre, along with uniformly strong acting work from, especially, Amy Matheny and Sheila Savage. M. Whittles Sheldon makes a passionate and petulant Electra. Through Sunday at the Griffin Theatre, 5404 N. Clark St. Phone 773-761-8284.
-- Chris Jones
"The Palace": Before the Blue Rider Theatre's Pilsen home was a fringe performance space, it was occupied by "The Palace," a combination vaudeville and opera house built in the early 1870s and reputed to be haunted. This fertile local history is the subject of Pablo Helguera's unusual new performance piece, well-directed by Tim Fiori and Scott Heckman. Employing imaginative environmental staging and framed by the experiences of a young writer moving into the gentrifying neighborhood, the eclectic show explores the boundaries of memory and dreams right in the specific site that the play is about. For anyone interested in Pilsen, "The Palace" holds many delights. Through March 9 at the Blue Rider Theatre, 1822 S. Halsted St. Phone 312-733-4668.

RHINO FESTIVAL'S THUNDERING TRIUMPHS `BABETTE'S FEAST' A TREAT FROM SOUP TO DESSERT

Author: Chris Jones. Special to the Tribune.

http://turing.library.northwestern.edu/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/418281117?accountid=12861

Abstract: With a gourmet eight-course dinner and show on offer for $17, it's no surprise that the limited tickets for Theatre Oobleck's weekly live re-creation of "Babette's Feast" (part of the Rhino in Winter Festival) are becoming as hot as the zesty turtle soup served by the Parisian to her unlikely guests at the Lunar Cabaret. The feast here (cooked by a team of six chefs de cuisine in the Lunar's kitchen and served by the actors) is truly a tour de force. Over the course of two hours, guests seated at two long tables munch their way through salad, bread-and-ale soup, gingered pancakes with spiced beets, chicken in puff pastry, fresh fruits and made-from-scratch desserts. There's so much eating going on that it draws focus away from the acting taking place between courses, but then that sense of excess is probably intentional.

Full text: With a gourmet eight-course dinner and show on offer for $17, it's no surprise that the limited tickets for Theatre Oobleck's weekly live re-creation of "Babette's Feast" (part of the Rhino in Winter Festival) are becoming as hot as the zesty turtle soup served by the Parisian to her unlikely guests at the Lunar Cabaret.
The feast here (cooked by a team of six chefs de cuisine in the Lunar's kitchen and served by the actors) is truly a tour de force. Over the course of two hours, guests seated at two long tables munch their way through salad, bread-and-ale soup, gingered pancakes with spiced beets, chicken in puff pastry, fresh fruits and made-from-scratch desserts. There's so much eating going on that it draws focus away from the acting taking place between courses, but then that sense of excess is probably intentional.
Made familiar by Gabriel Axel's remarkable 1987 film, Isak Dinesen's short story tells the unlikely tale of an active participant in the Paris Commune of 1871 who finds herself working for a pittance for two elderly sisters who supervise a remote religious community in Scandinavia. By showing the contrast between Babette's gastronomic brilliance and the austere lives of the people eating her meal, Dinesen explores the collision of revolutionary spirit with God-fearing absolutism.
But this is really about the sensual delights of food. As adapted by David Isaacson and others, Theatre Oobleck's environmental show captures the joy of the feast and there's a poignant performance from Teria Gartelos as Babette, hidden amid the clanging dishes. Some of the acting is a touch bombastic and the show features Oobleck's trademark loopy intellectualism, but there's real imagination, creativity and work on display.
The film version may be subtler and clearer in focus but you cannot eat a movie.

SQUEEZE IN THE CLOWNS NATIONAL PASTIME PACKS THREE RINGS OF FUN INTO `MIDNIGHT CIRCUS'

Author: Chris Jones. Special to the Tribune.

http://turing.library.northwestern.edu/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/418203236?accountid=12861

Abstract: The National Pastime Theatre is a tiny storefront performance house located in a undistinguished strip of North Broadway. It's the kind of place one expects to see earnest contemporary drama performed with minimalist setting for dour, fringe devotees. Right now it contains a circus. A real-life, honest-to-goodness, non-stop circus, complete with acrobats, rope dancers, clowns, trapezes, bungee chords, popcorn and noise-makers for all. It's one big belly laugh after another. And at $15 a ticket, this is one of the best entertainment buys in town. "The Midnight Circus" is the brainchild of Jeff Jenkins and Julie Greenberg, two Chicago fringe performers with legitimate circus training. The cast of 12 includes several veterans of Ringling Brothers Barnum and Bailey and the Kinoshita Circus of Japan. It's hard to fathom why all these highly trained people are doing this silly show for, obviously, very little money, but the main creative challenge for everyone seems to be the difficulty of doing a full-blown circus in a tiny indoor space. For the amazed audience, that's what makes this intimate, self-effacing show so much fun. The premise here is that a performance of a serious play is interrupted by a circus troupe that just happens to be wandering by. The frame is hardly subtle (neither is a pie in your face), but it allows "Midnight Circus" to have some harmless fun at the expense of the pomposity of Off-Loop theater.

Certainly one can see bigger and better acts in a big top, but when an acrobat is twirling away inches from your face, it's far more exciting. And ringmaster Jenkins, self-parodying opera diva, Sarah Worthington, and rubber-faced clown Nathan Carver would stack up against any circus performers in any tent anywhere.
Appropriate for families and blessed with a wicked sense of humor, the unpretentious "Midnight Circus" deserves a permanent home. Grab your noisemaker, suspend your dignity and go join the fun.

`WEST SIDE STORY' STILL MOVING

Author: Chris Jones. Special to the Tribune.

http://turing.library.northwestern.edu/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/418310284?accountid=12861

Abstract: One of the very few touring revivals to do gangbuster business this season, Alan Johnson's traditional re-creation of the celebrated 1957 musical "West Side Story" is making its second visit to Chicagoland but its first to the Rosemont Theatre, where the Jets and Sharks fight through Sunday. The cast changes are not a problem because the star here is the material. The beauty of Leonard Bernstein's greatest theater score and the heartbreak of the young lovers still stir the emotions. The banter of the 1950s juvenile delinquents may seem dated, and naive, but this show now seems sadly prophetic of tensions that would erupt on so many West Sides with a ferocity that the authors never imagined.

Full text: One of the very few touring revivals to do gangbuster business this season, Alan Johnson's traditional re-creation of the celebrated 1957 musical "West Side Story" is making its second visit to Chicagoland but its first to the Rosemont Theatre, where the Jets and Sharks fight through Sunday.
With the exception of the excellent Natascia A. Diaz as Anita, all the leads from the big-selling January 1996 Chicago Theatre sojourn have been replaced. The physical production remains identical.
The cast changes are not a problem because the star here is the material. The beauty of Leonard Bernstein's greatest theater score and the heartbreak of the young lovers still stir the emotions. The banter of the 1950s juvenile delinquents may seem dated, and naive, but this show now seems sadly prophetic of tensions that would erupt on so many West Sides with a ferocity that the authors never imagined.
Jeremy Koch's stiff but likable Tony has a soaring voice that's joined by Sharen Camille's vulnerable but grounded Maria.
There is no major attempt to update this structurally old-fashioned show for a new generation (that's a shame, perhaps). But if anyone needs proof that this show still packs a punch, just listen to the audience's silence at the climax of a timeless Broadway classic.

THE WORDS OF FREED SLAVES OFFER ELOQUENT TESTIMONY IN `DO LORD REMEMBER ME'

Abstract: The honest words of once-bound African-Americans make up James de Jongh's "Do Lord Remember Me," an arresting oral-history play initially produced by New York's New Federal Theatre in the early 1980s (and revived there just this year). In its first Chicago production, the memories of the slaves are now being relived on the South Side at the Chicago Theatre Company. They make a moving and compelling piece of theater. In the same way that "Schindler's List" rightly merited its network television broadcast, these true stories of slavery by those who lived through its holocaustic evils deserve a multiracial hearing -- especially by the young. And in Lisa Duncan's simple but emotionally wrenching Chicago production, a group of local actors connect viscerally with the true tales of whippings, suffering and defiance. There is no grand or unusual narrative scheme here; the playwright prefers to let the (sadly) unnamed characters' words speak for themselves. With beautifully sung spirituals (musical direction here is by Delano O'Banion) separating the stories of plantation life, actors alternate between impersonating the elderly tale-tellers and depicting the travails of the former slaves at earlier points in their lives. Actors like Sandra Watson and Woody Bolar are adept at rapid transitions of age and mood.

Full text: Among the many abiding cultural legacies of the Works Progress Administration is a series of transcribed interviews conducted in the 1930s with former slaves who were by then living quietly in what's described as an Old Folk's Home for Colored in Virginia.
The honest words of those once-bound African-Amer-
icans make up James de Jongh's "Do Lord Remember Me," an arresting oral-history play initially produced by New York's New Federal Theatre in the early 1980s (and revived there just this year). In its first Chicago production, the memories of the slaves are now being relived on the South Side at the Chicago Theatre Company. They make a moving and compelling piece of theater.
In the same way that "Schindler's List" rightly merited its network television broadcast, these true stories of slavery by those who lived through its holocaustic evils deserve a multiracial hearing -- especially by the young. And in Lisa Duncan's simple but emotionally wrenching Chicago production, a group of local actors connect viscerally with the true tales of whippings, suffering and defiance.
There is no grand or unusual narrative scheme here; the playwright prefers to let the (sadly) unnamed characters' words speak for themselves. With beautifully sung spirituals (musical direction here is by Delano O'Banion) separating the stories of plantation life, actors alternate between impersonating the elderly tale-tellers and depicting the travails of the former slaves at earlier points in their lives. Actors like Sandra Watson and Woody Bolar are adept at rapid transitions of age and mood.
While the overall tone is necessarily serious and sometimes somber, there are plenty of funny and entertaining stories here of insurrection and survival in a cruel world. But de Jongh knows how to make an audience's laughs catch in the middle of its collective throat: amusing anecdotes of youthful antics are usually arrested by memories of the brutal beatings (or killings) that followed any movement toward freedom.
While the mainly non-Equity cast is uniformly strong, Daniel Bryant is especially convincing as a sad but unbowed old man. And Greta Oglesby's vivid depiction of childhood abuse is both shocking and haunting. Patrick Kerwin's raked set provides a suitably neutral but poignant environment for events like the selling of a naked slave, powerfully played by Melvin R. Abston.
There are many details here about forced servitude that some people won't know, or perhaps care to forget (stories of white folks' attempts to rationalize the institution of slavery from the church pulpit are particularly striking). But these characters demand memory and awareness. As one old man remarks with a certain satisfaction, "God spared a few of us to tell the tale."
Thankfully, the government recorded the words for all to hear.

A NIGHT OF CAMP WILL BE A BENEFIT AT GRIFFIN THEATRE

Full text: From "Night of the Living Dead" through "Plan 9 From Outer Space," there's a long and ignoble Chicago theater tradition of exploiting cult film screenplays for live late-night laughs.
In some tiny space or other around midnight, a bunch of unsubtle actors typically re-create scenes from some B-movie staple in front of a boozed-up crowd looking for perverse and participatory nostalgia.
Sweetback Productions, a master of this subgenre, re-enacts the 1974 John Waters shocker "Female Trouble" each Saturday.
The actors squeeze every scene from the raunchy vehicle by Divine into the confines of Andersonville's Griffin Theatre.
A consciously uneasy mix of prison melodrama and angst-ridden tale of teenagers gone wrong, the early Waters flick is beloved by fans of such other bad-taste classics as "Pink Flamingos" and "Desperate Living."
This Tuesday, a member of the original movie cast of "Female Trouble" joins the theatrical interlopers, benefiting the AIDS Foundation of Chicago.
Elizabeth Coffey, a minor but memorable player in much of the Waters oeuvre (she appears as an unforgettable flasher in "Pink Flamingos") will once again essay the role of Earnestine, heroine Dawn Davenport's jailhouse lover.
The AIDS Foundation's Amy Landecker describes the event as "an unforgettable night of unadulterated camp."
Coffey is now happily married and living in relative obscurity in Rockford.
As of Sunday night, she confessed that she had not yet seen the Sweetback show nor had any actual rehearsal (the lines, it seems, are indelibly etched on her consciousness).
And why drag out a role she played on film some 23 years ago?
"I wanted to pop up and provide a touch of color for a worthy cause," she says, noting that she devotes most of her time to Rockford's AIDS-related organizations.
"There's a whole new audience now," muses the good-natured Coffey.
She adds that she is "very proud" of the work she participated in with Waters.
----------
"Female Trouble" plays at 11 p.m. Saturdays at the Griffin Theatre, 5401 N. Clark St.; the AIDS Foundation benefit takes place at 8 p.m. Tuesday. The $20 tickets include a pre-show reception. For more information, call 312-922-2322.

REVIVING `SAVED' WORTHWHILE BLEAK '65 DRAMA ABOUT DYSFUNCTIONAL PARENTING MORE MEANINGFUL NOW

Author: Chris Jones. Special to the Tribune.

http://turing.library.northwestern.edu/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/418311203?accountid=12861

Abstract: When Edward Bond's notorious play "Saved" was written in 1965, it was immediately banned in the author's native Britain. This irredeemably bleak family drama was unfairly seen at the time as the epitome of amoral decadence and sensationalism, with critics focusing on a singularly horrible scene in which a group of young men torture a baby in its carriage. And yet, as this tiny storefront production of "Saved" battled its way through the evening at the Profiles Theatre, at least one initially reluctant reviewer was newly struck by how much this talky and cyclical play was ahead of its time.

Full text: When Edward Bond's notorious play "Saved" was written in 1965, it was immediately banned in the author's native Britain.
This irredeemably bleak family drama was unfairly seen at the time as the epitome of amoral decadence and sensationalism, with critics focusing on a singularly horrible scene in which a group of young men torture a baby in its carriage.
Given the depressing subject matter and the chronological and geographic removes, one questioned the wisdom of Funkdubious and Azusa Productions in reviving this shocking and long play about a tawdry love triangle and dysfunctional parenting.
And yet, as this tiny storefront production of "Saved" battled its way through the evening at the Profiles Theatre, at least one initially reluctant reviewer was newly struck by how much this talky and cyclical play was ahead of its time.
A maligned but moral rock in a floundering and selfish society, Bond's central character of Len (beautifully played by Reid Coker) is exactly like Mike Leigh's photographer/hero in his thematically similar film, "Secrets and Lies."
And the babbling television-preaching, consumerist decadence in "Saved" anticipates commonplace worries about the electronic baby-sitter. Most of Bond's social fears in 1965, it seems, have come true--over here and over there.
Some of the surprising power of this piece doubtless comes from an earnest and highly competent production, directed by Patrick Wilkes and Maggie Speer, with a heavy focus on the acting.
Strikingly reminiscent of Jane Horrocks, Georgina Stoyles is excellent as the reluctant young mother, throwing her entire body into a tightly focused, sometimes manic performance. Tom Daniel is appropriately nasty as the object of her desire.
"Saved" is not an easy play to sit through (cumbersome transitions slow the pacing). But there are deep societal problems being probed with intensity by a young cast with considerable potential.

SMOKING, DRINKING, GAMBLING, SEX -- `VICES' DOESN'T MISS MUCH

Author: Jones, Chris

http://turing.library.northwestern.edu/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/418317075?accountid=12861

Abstract: So there's something refreshingly honest about "Vices," the new pop-rock musical that has its debut Sunday night at the Theatre Building. With blatant appeal to amoral Gen X-ers, this new show by a team of four young and unknown authors is themed around such nasty habits as smoking, drinking, gambling and, of course, sex. The Chicago debut of "Vices" is the beginning of a road that producer Arielle Tepper hopes will lead towards New York. Tepper, who is only 24 years old, says she first saw the show at a workshop held at New York's Orpheum Theatre in fall 1994.

Full text: The theatrical depiction of sin has sold plenty of tickets ever since Oedipus made the mistake of marrying his mother.
So there's something refreshingly honest about "Vices," the new pop-rock musical that has its debut Sunday night at the Theatre Building.
With blatant appeal to amoral Gen X-ers, this new show by a team of four young and unknown authors is themed around such nasty habits as smoking, drinking, gambling and, of course, sex.
"Everyone has a little something hidden in their closet," says co-author and choreographer Everett Bradley, "we'll just be opening the door."
The Chicago debut of "Vices" is the beginning of a road that producer Arielle Tepper hopes will lead towards New York. Tepper, who is only 24 years old, says she first saw the show at a workshop held at New York's Orpheum Theatre in fall 1994.
Impressed with the energy and enthusiasm of the authors and the audience, Tepper arranged for a recording of the score and set out to find some backers.
"We decided to come to Chicago," Tepper says, "because it has the reputation of being a hip, young theater town."
Audiences here this weekend can expect a show in the beginning stages of development (locally based Fox Theatricals is serving as general manager for the project).
Three of the authors are also part of the cast (Michael Heitzman and Ilene Reid join Bradley on stage), and Tepper has hired three local Chicago performers to round out this new musical.
Hip and youthful urbanites are the target crowd and Tepper variously describes the material with words like "hot," "sexy," "alternative" and "contemporary."
One number is entirely about an illicit relationship in an America Online chat-room: The venues of vice may change but not its appeal on a Saturday night.

COURT'S `PHILADELPHIA STORY' HONORS ITS AUTHOR

Author: Chris Jones. Special to the Tribune.

http://turing.library.northwestern.edu/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/418328643?accountid=12861

Abstract: Among the American playwrights of the fertile and volatile 1930s, Eugene O'Neill, Elmer Rice and Lillian Hellman are usually regarded as the major figures, writing weighty dramas about the social and spiritual dilemmas of their day. And several of their works are the subjects of recent and forthcoming revivals in Chicago (Hellman's 1960 play, "Toys in the Attic," for one, soon will be presented at the American Blues Theatre). Philip Barry, by contrast, has been typed as an author of inconsequential comedies of high society manners, in particular "The Philadelphia Story" and "Holiday." Those plays, of course, gave rise to the films of those names, in which the likes of Katharine Hepburn and Cary Grant engage in sensually intellectual banter while wearing evening dress. With its production this week of the 1939 play "The Philadelphia Story," the Court Theatre is eager to rescue a major American playwright. As if to underline his belief in Barry's stature, Court artistic director Charles Newell has paired the upcoming production of "The Philadelphia Story" with a version of Moliere's "Tartuffe."

Full text: Among the American playwrights of the fertile and volatile 1930s, Eugene O'Neill, Elmer Rice and Lillian Hellman are usually regarded as the major figures, writing weighty dramas about the social and spiritual dilemmas of their day. And several of their works are the subjects of recent and forthcoming revivals in Chicago (Hellman's 1960 play, "Toys in the Attic," for one, soon will be presented at the American Blues Theatre).
Philip Barry, by contrast, has been typed as an author of inconsequential comedies of high society manners, in particular "The Philadelphia Story" and "Holiday." Those plays, of course, gave rise to the films of those names, in which the likes of Katharine Hepburn and Cary Grant engage in sensually intellectual banter while wearing evening dress.
The stars of those movies and their director (George Cukor) remain familiar names, while the playwright has almost been forgotten. Yet Barry appears to be enjoying something of a renaissance in the Chicago theater this season.
Impulse Theatre enjoyed a palpable hit with its Christmas production of "Holiday," Barry's tale of a rugged individualist struggling against a stultifying family background that almost produces a money-dominated and consequently loveless marriage. Audiences and critics alike enjoyed Barry's intoxicating blend of slick and stylish one-liners with engaging political and personal themes.
With its production this week of the 1939 play "The Philadelphia Story," the Court Theatre is eager to rescue a major American playwright. As if to underline his belief in Barry's stature, Court artistic director Charles Newell has paired the upcoming production of "The Philadelphia Story" with a version of Moliere's "Tartuffe."
"Even though Barry became an icon of the comedy of manners, he actually wrote plays that are psychologically complex and difficult," says Newell. "He knew that being a human being is about weakness, complexity and ambiguity and not just about strength, simplicity and purity. This is a deeply human story about what it means to be a person."
And will audiences familiar with the film be watching a re-creation of familiar Hollywood acting styles and studio settings? Newell says he has something very different in mind.
"There are a lot of layers to this piece that I don't think the movie ever probed," he says. "The story takes place during the Depression. We're emphasizing the emotional complexity of the work. If there's some exploration of the darkness beyond the cuteness, the emotional payoff for the audience is even greater."
Kate Fry has the challenge of playing the Hepburn role, a recently divorced Philadelphia ice maiden named Tracy Lord who's on the eve of marriage to a much duller (but supposedly more considerate) fellow named George Kittredge, when she realizes that she is still in love with her cynical first husband, C.K. Dexter Haven.
"I think it is important for me to find my own way into the role," says Fry. "This is about a woman realizing her own frailty and having the courage to admit that she is not invincible. In 1990s terminology, Tracy Lord is a control freak."
As was the case last season, Court is producing two shows together for its spring slot: "The Philadelphia Story" rotates with "Tartuffe." At first glance that may seem like a strange choice, given that the two shows have nothing thematic in common -- one is a 16th Century French comedy, the other an American play from the 1930s.
But Newell says he picks shows based on how well they match casting needs (they need to have roughly the same number of roles), not on how well they fit together. He also is at pains to pick two shows that allow actors to play lead roles in one show and then a smaller part in the other, making the rehearsal process a little less arduous.
Although the settings are both designed by Todd Rosenthal, they have very little in common. "You come and see one production," says Rosenthal, "then you come back and see something completely different. We try very hard to make the other show completely disappear. About the only thing we reuse is the chandelier."
So why put everyone through the stress of doing two shows at once? Newell argues that the method of production allows for a longer total rehearsal period, meaning that actors can gel as a company. It also lets the creative team work on one show intensely and then turn their attentions to the other, allowing ideas to percolate over time. And on a more prosaic level, the longer run time allows word of mouth to build, if response to the shows is favorable.
Audiences, for their part, can choose to see both productions together on some Saturdays and every Sunday of the run (there's a good-sized dinner break between the plays).
"We love it when people see two shows on one day because they see the range of what an actor can do," says Newell. "When you see an actor do two completely different parts in two completely different plays, you actually learn something about the actor as a person."
And, if all goes well, audiences should also learn a thing or two about one of America's most underrated playwrights.

WASTE OF TALENT IS THE REAL SIN OF `VICES'

Author: Chris Jones. Special to the Tribune.

http://turing.library.northwestern.edu/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/418319533?accountid=12861

Abstract: The new rock musical "Vices" is reviewed. Slickly and expensively produced at the Theatre Building by Arielle Tepper with an eye on New York, this potentially lucrative affair will only enjoy an afterlife if its clearly talented creators are willing to throw away about half of what they are currently presenting. The show's strengths are obvious and considerable. The four creators know how to write strong, driving melodies, and Draus' band sounds lush and full. There's also some exciting choreography from Bradley, the most obvious talent on the stage. So when the headset-clad actors are jumping around "Rent"-style in big production numbers like "Hit Me" (guess the vice) and "Some Like It" (all kinds of ways), the show jumps with life. There's also a poignant drug-themed ballad called "All the Money," beautifully sung by Reid, an experienced jazz vocalist. But one moment of honesty and a single exploration of the downside of vice is hardly enough.

Full text: Alternately sophisticated and sophomoric, the new commercial rock musical "Vices" is a schizophrenic show in which solid creative impulses are drowned out by a raft of lousy material.
Slickly and expensively produced at the Theatre Building by Arielle Tepper with an eye on New York, this potentially lucrative affair will only enjoy an afterlife if its clearly talented creators are willing to throw away about half of what they are currently presenting.
The premise here is beguiling -- a musical based on sin. Given that most people are guilty of some combination of drinking, smoking, excessive sex, overeating, gambling, obsessive bodybuilding and assorted other pleasures of the flesh, a revue-style show in which each number is themed around a different vice should be able to provoke some audience identification.
But that assumption rests on the theatrical depiction of truth -- a quality in short supply here. Instead of probing the reasons we turn to vice or offering unusual explications of sinful acts, author/performers Everett Bradley, Susan Draus, Michael Heitzman and Ilene Reid deliver too many cliched vignettes and twee personal monologues that are of no interest to anyone other than the writers' friends.
The show's strengths are obvious and considerable. The four creators know how to write strong, driving melodies, and Draus' band sounds lush and full. There's also some exciting choreography from Bradley, the most obvious talent on the stage. So when the headset-clad actors are jumping around "Rent"-style in big production numbers like "Hit Me" (guess the vice) and "Some Like It" (all kinds of ways), the show jumps with life. There's also a poignant drug-themed ballad called "All the Money," beautifully sung by Reid, an experienced jazz vocalist. But one moment of honesty and a single exploration of the downside of vice is hardly enough.
When the overlong "Vices" tries to be funny, its energy disappears -- precious little of the humor works. A series of silly skits may make everyone a few bucks in the short run, but these young writers are too talented to waste their energies on the obvious.

BENSON'S WATSON AN APPEALING 2ND BANANA

Author: Chris Jones. Special to the Tribune.

Abstract: Actor Dale Benson works almost continuously at the Candlelight Forum Theatre and Dinner Playhouse: He has played more than 300 characters in his 36 years on the two stages. A perhaps inevitable result of this steady employ is that he is sometimes the victim (or, depending on how he looks at it, the beneficiary) of some inappropriate casting. But Benson is perfect for Dr. Watson in Charles Marowitz's "Sherlock's Last Case." And his exceptional acting work in this difficult role proves what his many fans well know: This is a fine craftsman capable of marrying sterling comic technique with heartfelt moments of real poignancy. Seeing the redoubtable Benson in a part that shows his talent and experience to such great effect is worth the price of admission. Even though he plays the plodding sidekick to the famously arrogant Baker Street sleuth (slickly portrayed here by the urbane Ned Schmidtke), Benson is actually the star of this show. While it's hard to reveal much about the plot of Marowitz's subtly anachronistic version of a traditional Sherlock Holmes detective story without spoiling the suspense, it's within bounds to note that Watson here goes through a severe crisis of the spirit. Showing real vulnerability, Benson offers a sad side of the good doctor that the reader of armchair fiction will likely have never imagined.

Happily, Larry Wyatt's truthful production is very good in other ways: Wyatt is adept at including focused little bits of physical business that draw the eye and reveal the director's care. And even though this show has just two simple settings and a small cast (David Lively, Wendi Weber and Lolly Trausht all offer excellent character work), Marowitz's meticulous but anarchic and American take on a traditional form keeps things stimulating. There's plenty of dark humor along with an interesting exploration of the limits of servitude.
Dramatizations of Sherlock Holmes stories often surprise audiences by their complexity and ambiguity. But fans of one of Chicago's most beloved actors will endure no shocks; just confirmation of how much (in the right role) Benson can give to an audience.

`HAIR' COMPOSER SEES HIS LESSER-KNOWN `HUMAN COMEDY' REVIVED

Author: Chris Jones. Special to the Tribune.

http://turing.library.northwestern.edu/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/418304953?accountid=12861

Abstract: None available.

Full text: `The Second World War," says Galt MacDermot, making an unusual comparison over the telephone line from New York, "was a little bit like Vietnam. People lost their fathers and sons. And, even back then, Americans had a moral ambivalence towards foreign wars."
That moral ambivalence (especially among the young and/or rebellious) has made MacDermot a great deal of money since 1968, when he wrote the music for "Hair," the then-outrageous hippie rock musical that introduced songs like "Aquarius" and "Good Morning Starshine" to the books of standards and forever changed the sound and the moral compass of Broadway.
The object of numerous international productions, a film and several revivals (including a poorly received collegiate incarnation at the Athenaeum Theatre last summer), "Hair" keeps generating healthy royalties for its genial composer.
But the books of musical theater history tend to associate MacDermot's name only with that bejeaned and beaded celebration of peace and love. In fact, MacDermot also showed up on Broadway in 1984, when his musical adaptation of William Saroyan's "The Human Comedy" (lyrics by William Dumaresq) made a brief appearance at the Royale Theatre (the current home of "Dream," a previewing new musical starring Leslie Ann Warren). If "Dream" turns into a nightmare as quickly as did "The Human Comedy," its investors will not be laughing: MacDermot's show was a tragedy on West 45th Street, lasting less than 12 weeks.
"It just didn't look like a Broadway show," remembers MacDermot, without any apparent bitterness. "I had written something that was between an opera and an oratorio. It worked well in a small downtown theater. But the larger space was not used right on Broadway. The show is all about feelings and it lost all of its intimacy. I thought the people involved knew what they were doing. But they didn't."
That small downtown space was actually New York's Public Theatre and its producer was the late and legendary Joseph Papp. The show did well while it was still at the cozy Public, enjoying a premiere run of more than three months.
But a Broadway rejection tends to tarnish a show and thus "The Human Comedy" has not been heard of all that much in the intervening 13 years: MacDermot has vague memories of professional productions in Boston and one somewhere in southern California but he cannot remember the theaters (actually, the Candlelight Dinner Playhouse in Summit also produced the show, in 1989).
Now MacDermot can name one. The Splinter Group is reviving "The Human Comedy" at the Theatre Building, opening on Sunday. Although the announced run is only through April 13, the ambitious theater company is hoping that the production will be around for much longer than that.
For one thing, it's a lot of work for a smallish Chicago troupe: There are 20 people in the cast, all of whom must warble their way through a complex musical score that mixes folk, pop, gospel and operatic tropes. The budget for the show is a healthy but eminently reasonable $66,000 and the cast includes names like Dina Joy Byrd and George Keating, veterans of the small world of off-Loop Chicago musicals.
Happily for MacDermot and the producing theater, many people have heard of the source material, not least because Saroyan's novel is required reading in many high schools. Set during the Second World War in the California village of Ithaca, the tale follows a family devastated by the times -- with her husband dead and her oldest boy away at war, Kate Macauley watches over her three other children, one of whom spends his days delivering Western Union telegrams announcing the dead.
Why would a small (and sometimes indebted) Chicago theater company take on such complicated and problematic material?
"One of the things we specialize in is taking shows that made a splash and then disappeared," says Splinter Group artistic director Matt O'Brien. "We try to find the elements that can make them successful. This show was designed to be unspectacular -- it's all about the story and the singers and the music."
For most Chicago theatergoers, The Splinter Group is all about Samuel Beckett. Last year, the company spent some $250,000 on its "Buckets O' Beckett" series of works by the celebrated absurdist, tempting name performers like Estelle Parsons. That level of ambition is typical of O'Brien and his company, which is adept at snagging grants and marketing its shows with a level of professionalism unmatched by most of the company's peers. O'Brien is eager to remind people that The Splinter Group is perfectly capable of producing a musical (as they did during the 1994-95 season with Marc Blitzstein's "The Cradle Will Rock").
"Now that our name is well established, we want to make sure that people know we do something other than Beckett," says O'Brien, who co-directs "The Human Comedy" with Chris McNamara. "It's tough to survive in this market. Our audience needs to understand that when they buy the Splinter Group concept, they are going to get something unusual."

FROZEN IN TIME UNWIELDY ICE CAPADES TRIES TO PLEASE

Author: Chris Jones. Special to the Tribune.

http://turing.library.northwestern.edu/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/418316300?accountid=12861

Abstract: Ice Capades has been skating across the country since 1940. And with more than 60 cities on the nine-month tour of the 1996-97 production, "The Magic of MGM," demand is obviously still strong for a family-oriented blend of skating, circus and theater. Unlike some other touring frozen shows, Ice Capades has long placed more of an emphasis on splashy Vegas-style production numbers and light entertainment than axel jumps and camel spins. Various stars have joined the casts over the years, but with television specials now paying higher fees, it's become harder to tempt name performers to commit for nine months (Canadian Olympian Elizabeth Manley is sometimes part of this cast, but she's appearing in only three of the eight shows in Chicago; gymnast Kerri Strug was originally listed as performing here, but she's not in the show).

Full text: Ice Capades has been skating across the country since 1940. And with more than 60 cities on the nine-month tour of the 1996-97 production, "The Magic of MGM," demand is obviously still strong for a family-oriented blend of skating, circus and theater.
But a look at this well-meaning but unwieldy show during its current stop at the UIC Pavilion reveals a venerable variety institution struggling to keep up with the ever-changing face of family entertainment.
Unlike some other touring frozen shows, Ice Capades has long placed more of an emphasis on splashy Vegas-style production numbers and light entertainment than axel jumps and camel spins. Various stars have joined the casts over the years, but with television specials now paying higher fees, it's become harder to tempt name performers to commit for nine months (Canadian Olympian Elizabeth Manley is sometimes part of this cast, but she's appearing in only three of the eight shows in Chicago; gymnast Kerri Strug was originally listed as performing here, but she's not in the show).
The theme of this tour is the MGM movie catalog. Sometimes that works well, as during nicely designed salutes to "West Side Story" and "Goldfinger." But a long number dedicated to the forgettable adult sci-fi flick "Stargate" left most kids missing R2D2, and a needless tribute to "Tank Girl" fell equally flat.
Kids enjoyed character appearances by the Pink Panther (although putting 10 of them on ice is rather like revealing several Santa Claus at once; Disney never allows two simultaneously visible Mickeys). Other MGM creations like the Lionhart Family and the creatures from "All Dogs Go to Heaven" are only partially recognizable by most pint-sized folk.
Smaller than the United Center, the UIC Pavilion is a good ice-show venue (concessions prices are cheaper, too). There is accomplished and enjoyable skating from soloist Vadim Shabeco and principal pair, Wayne and Natalie Seybold. "Pyro skater" Eddi Vallon shoots fireworks from his arms and legs to the delight of the kids in the crowd. And Betty Okina performs her Olympic brand of gymnastics at the side of the rink with real theatrical flair.
But this overlong show has some dull stretches when kids become restless and adults scratch their heads trying to figure out the creators' intentions. What Ice Capades needs is a unifying creative idea that could pull its many parts together in the way that Cirque de Soleil has reinvented the circus -- so that it delights the senses and stirs the spirit.
"Ice Capades: The Magic of MGM" continues through Sunday at the UIC Pavilion, 1150 W. Harrison St. For tickets and performance times, phone 312-413-5740.

THE STAGE TRANSFORMATION OF `DORIAN GRAY'

Author: Chris Jones. Special to the Tribune.

http://turing.library.northwestern.edu/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/418287980?accountid=12861

Abstract: Even though the enigmatic Oscar Wilde wrote many popular plays, it's not surprising that people cannot resist dramatizing his one famous novel, "The Picture of Dorian Gray." By contrast, "The Picture of Dorian Gray" seems to have it all. The trademark crowd-pleasing epigrams are firmly in place, but this tale of a beautiful young man whose portrait progressively reflects his growing cruelty, also has a tense and macabre plot, not to mention a bloody climax involving murder and suicide that rivals the best of Edgar Allan Poe. Wilde's acid wit is firmly aimed at the social conventions of the time, but this ode to the horrors of selfish youth also shows his dark and conflicted side. It seems, at times, as if the playwright is exploring the very dangers of his own persona. The tale is known to movie fans through Albert Lewin's 1945 film, in which the ice-cool Hurd Hatfield played the wealthy and exquisite young man who brings misery to everyone he touches (but hides his aging portrait in the attic). Back in 1992, the late, lamented Wisdom Bridge Theatre Company produced Terry McCabe's powerful production of an impressive adaptation by Paul Edwards, in which the characters in the drama alternately served as narrator, thus preserving the book's vivid descriptive passages. Opening March 31 is the latest live version of "The Picture of Dorian Gray," adapted and directed by John McCrite, who titles his adaptation produced at the Bailiwick Repertory Theatre and titled just "Dorian Gray."

Full text: Even though the enigmatic Oscar Wilde wrote many popular plays, it's not surprising that people cannot resist dramatizing his one famous novel, "The Picture of Dorian Gray."
In all but one of the celebrated dramas left behind by the high priest of aestheticism (such as "An Ideal Husband" and "The Importance of Being Earnest"), characters lounge around in upper-class sitting rooms and dispense one witty and perfectly phrased epigram after another, never threatening their amused audience.
These oft-produced 19th Century plays are stylish and fiendishly funny (and a decent director can detect serious hidden themes), but there's always a sense that the playwright is, well, hiding something.
As author, director, and Wilde devotee Steven Berkoff notes with some validity, "these are plays of concealment. They were written with witty epigrams to entertain the largely moronic upper-middle class audience of the period; the very people who threw him in jail."
Yet Wilde's one serious and revelatory play, "Salome" (produced here last Christmas at the Footsteps Theatre) is so grim and severe that few theater companies with an eye on the box-office dare to produce the historical shocker -- and those that do are certainly not in the business of providing their audience with a night of laughs.
By contrast, "The Picture of Dorian Gray" seems to have it all. The trademark crowd-pleasing epigrams are firmly in place, but this tale of a beautiful young man whose portrait progressively reflects his growing cruelty, also has a tense and macabre plot, not to mention a bloody climax involving murder and suicide that rivals the best of Edgar Allan Poe. Wilde's acid wit is firmly aimed at the social conventions of the time, but this ode to the horrors of selfish youth also shows his dark and conflicted side. It seems, at times, as if the playwright is exploring the very dangers of his own persona.
In other words, one could argue that serious and trivial Wilde coexist only in narrative form. Hence, perhaps the popularity of converting "Dorian Gray" into drama -- it also helps that the 1891 story is now in public domain, fair and free game for any literary adapter.
The tale is known to movie fans through Albert Lewin's 1945 film, in which the ice-cool Hurd Hatfield played the wealthy and exquisite young man who brings misery to everyone he touches (but hides his aging portrait in the attic). Back in 1992, the late, lamented Wisdom Bridge Theatre Company produced Terry McCabe's powerful production of an impressive adaptation by Paul Edwards, in which the characters in the drama alternately served as narrator, thus preserving the book's vivid descriptive passages. Opening March 31 is the latest live version of "The Picture of Dorian Gray," adapted and directed by John McCrite, who titles his adaptation produced at the Bailiwick Repertory Theatre and titled just "Dorian Gray."
"I didn't like any of the previous versions I have read," says McCrite, who says he hopes to publish this new version, which has been extensively workshopped. "The challenge was to find the action of the piece; Wilde's trademark was epigrams and it's hard for an actor to play wit."
Thus McCrite came up with an over-riding theme that seemed appropriate for an author who himself led a double life (although Wilde was married with children, his homosexuality resulted in his prosecution and imprisonment).
"All of the characters in `Dorian Gray' have a secret," says McCrite. "They all want to keep their hidden lives. The main action of the play is for the characters to keep hiding their secrets."
McCrite says he has decided that the three central characters in the play all represent different sides of their creator. The diabolic Lord Harry reflects the popular opinion of Wilde; the artist, Basil, depicts how the playwright actually saw himself; Dorian Gray represents the beautiful young man Wilde would liked to have been.
Are we supposed to sympathize with this degenerate young aesthete, the object of everyone's desire?
"Oh no," says Novak. "If the audience likes him, I will not have done my job."
These days, of course, it's possible to treat Wilde's gay themes in a more direct manner (the novel contains a speech in which one character declares his love for another man with such passion that it was used against Wilde in his real-life trial). McCrite says that he is anxious to rescue the issues of sexuality that were predictably downplayed in the 1945 film, which emphasized the supernatural over the personal.
"This book is about the conflicts that arise when a man has desires for another man, and those desires have to be covered up," McCrite says. "And those conflicts are still very much around for gay people: we still are dealing with `don't ask, don't tell' policies."

AUTHOR'S DEMAGOGUERY UNDERMINES `CUT'

Author: Chris Jones. Special to the Tribune.

http://turing.library.northwestern.edu/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/418334493?accountid=12861

Abstract: In the view of playwright Louis Peter Cimino, an unholy alliance of powerful drug companies, hospital managers and the American Medical Association has conspired to prevent cancer patients from gaining access to potentially life-saving holistic treatments. With the same energy that novelist John Grisham attacked Big Tobacco in a work of fiction, Cimino's conspiracy-minded "Cut, Poison and Burn" goes after Big Medicine with such intensity that those opposed to the author's point of view are depicted as money-grubbing drug pushers, akin to dealers on the street. One's view of this subject matter of this controversial new play, premiered by the Mary-Arrchie Theatre Company, will depend on one's view of alternative health care. But Cimino does not seem interested in exploring what could be an interesting debate about the role of the healer in modern society, preferring to blow down his straw doctors in suits and trumpet his own controversial views on cancer therapy.

In many ways, such overt one-sidedness blunts the play's political power. Instead of believable human beings, Cimino presents predictable characters who talk out of newspapers, reciting statistics and taking positions that serve only the playwright's ideas.
"Cut, Poison and Burn" (a titular reference to surgery, chemotherapy and radiation) has a melodramatic plot and standard character types right out of any number of formulaic films. An earnest young doctor (played by Chuck Quinn) is slowly introduced to the evils of his profession by an earnest but emotionally troubled lawyer (Kristin Reninger) who ends up defending him (and taking on the entire medical establishment) in the courtroom climax.
Amid this backdrop, a young cancer patient (Adria Dawn) is subjected to one invasive treatment after another, mainly to serve the needs of her pathetic physician (Vince Pinto).
With a cast of 17, this over-long play tests Mary-Arrchie's resources. One must admire the willingness to produce controversial new work, but John DiFusco's under-rehearsed production was not ready for the public on opening night--several actors barely knew their lines. The show's needless and endless set changes need to be incised, and the whole affair lacks visual clarity.
Cimino at least has clarity of theme--cancer is kept alive by an establishment invested in not finding a cure. After his anger subsides, this former medical student will be in a better position to write a piece of theater that serves his purpose.

WINNING PAIR IRA GLASS, BEAU O'REILLY MAKE A FORMIDABLE TEAM IN ENGAGING `RADIO TEARS'

Author: Chris Jones. Special to the Tribune.

Abstract: "Radio Tears: Stories From `This American Life'" begins with the audience in the dark. The smooth, amplified and irrepressibly quizzical voice of National Public Radio's Ira Glass explains that this is the great advantage of radio reporting -- a listener cannot judge people by how they appear, only by the power of their words. Glass jokes with the audience that, if he had his way, the entire piece of theater that they are about to see would take place with no lights. But, he says, Beau O'Reilly objected. With that yin and yang opening, Glass and O'Reilly perform a bizarre double act in the Steppenwolf Studio. Borrowing the format of WBEZ Chicago's "This American Life," Glass' contemplative radio news magazine, this pair of storytellers each contribute three stories on subjects varying from the frozen smile of Julia Roberts to the media's distortion of issues of race to the relationships of these men with their families. But despite this strange combination (or perhaps because of it), this contemplative piece of theater carries the audience along wherever it goes. The boyish Glass (whose radio work last week won a Peabody Award) has an incomparable ability to hook his listeners with a human interest story, probably because he seems fascinated by life's paradoxes and in love with its victims. The gruffer O'Reilly just throws his truths out in the light and wrestles with them in public -- his emotional monologue about his late father, celebrated actor James O'Reilly, is raw and riveting.

Full text: `Radio Tears: Stories From `This American Life' " begins with the audience in the dark. The smooth, amplified and irrepressibly quizzical voice of National Public Radio's Ira Glass explains that this is the great advantage of radio reporting -- a listener cannot judge people by how they appear, only by the power of their words. Glass jokes with the audience that, if he had his way, the entire piece of theater that they are about to see would take place with no lights. But, he says, Beau O'Reilly objected.
Of course he did. Fringe theater veteran O'Reilly is a highly physical performer with a shuffling gait but blazing eyes. You have to see him to fully appreciate him.
With that yin and yang opening, Glass and O'Reilly perform a bizarre double act in the Steppenwolf Studio. Borrowing the format of WBEZ Chicago's "This American Life," Glass' contemplative radio news magazine, this pair of storytellers each contribute three stories on subjects varying from the frozen smile of Julia Roberts to the media's distortion of issues of race to the relationships of these men with their families.
The O'Reilly tales of Midwestern life are theatrical monologues, based on true experience but recounted with stylized verve and occupying most of the stage. Glass, on the other hand, sits behind a mixer board and a bank of wires, re-creating his radio persona. He fiddles with tapes, inserts segments of interviews, extemporizes on a live microphone, and his body hardly moves.
But despite this strange combination (or perhaps because of it), this contemplative piece of theater carries the audience along wherever it goes. The boyish Glass (whose radio work last week won a Peabody Award) has an incomparable ability to hook his listeners with a human interest story, probably because he seems fascinated by life's paradoxes and in love with its victims. The gruffer O'Reilly just throws his truths out in the light and wrestles with them in public -- his emotional monologue about his late father, celebrated actor James O'Reilly, is raw and riveting.
"Radio Tears" could further develop its exploration of how different media reflect life in different ways, but it's already an engaging evening because these men are as wise as they are vulnerable. Heavy with Chicagoland references, these are 90 warm and reflective minutes, full of ideas about the wonder and sadness of life.

SOUTH AFRICAN POLITICS DRIVES PUPPET VERSION OF FAUST STORY

Author: Jones, Chris

http://turing.library.northwestern.edu/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/418312317?accountid=12861

Abstract: Ever since Christopher Marlowe dramatized his misdeeds in the 16th Century, the unfortunate fellow who sold his soul to the devil in return for wealth of a more transitory nature has proved to be a pliable and poignant symbol of short-sightedness. Dr. Faustus has been immortalized by Goethe and Gertrude Stein, outwitted on the silver screen, and (thanks to Randy Newman) he recently metamorphosed into a punkish Notre Dame undergraduate named Henry Faust, title character of a rock musical. But for South African William Kentridge, the most Faustian arena is politics. Specifically, Kentridge sees a rich irony in the current expedient reconciliation of the oppressed in South Africa with those who were (until recently) doing most of the oppressing.

Full text: Ever since Christopher Marlowe dramatized his misdeeds in the 16th Century, the unfortunate fellow who sold his soul to the devil in return for wealth of a more transitory nature has proved to be a pliable and poignant symbol of short-sightedness.
Dr. Faustus has been immortalized by Goethe and Gertrude Stein, outwitted on the silver screen, and (thanks to Randy Newman) he recently metamorphosed into a punkish Notre Dame undergraduate named Henry Faust, title character of a rock musical.
But for South African William Kentridge, the most Faustian arena is politics. Specifically, Kentridge sees a rich irony in the current expedient reconciliation of the oppressed in South Africa with those who were (until recently) doing most of the oppressing.
"It was very much a Faustian contract," Kentridge says, "between different angels and devils. That moral paradox is what the new South Africa is based upon. We made a deal with the netherworld, and we have an ongoing contract with the devil."
Kentridge is the director and originator of "Faustus in Africa," a touring puppet version based on Goethe's take on the old tale and produced by Johannesburg's Handspring Puppet Company.
In this incarnation, Faustus takes the guise of a white colonialist who sells his soul to Mephisto, a black bureaucrat. As they did in Kentridge's "Woyczek on the Highveld" (seen here in 1995), the life-size puppets share the stage with actors and a film backdrop.
"We use animated projections so we can display people's unconscious thoughts," Kentridge says. "As an audience you watch a double performance -- you see the actor manipulating the puppet, but you also believe in what the puppet is doing. There's pleasure in allowing yourself to be fooled by a piece of wood."
Dr. Faustus would surely have sympathized.

Full text: "Glamour": Best known for her well-received solo adaptation of the Dorothy Parker short story "Big Blonde," writer-performer Shirley Anderson enjoys working on women's fiction from the 1920s, a time when prose scribes often used the romantic sophistication of the age as a concealing metaphor for the emptiness of personal lives. For her latest hourlong, one-woman show, the adventurous Anderson turns to the oft-neglected writings of Edna Ferber, a former Chicago newspaper writer and novelist. Ferber's subtle short story "Glamour" exposes Broadway diva Linda Fayne, whose life is far more troubled than its seemingly alluring whirl of power and beauty. There are emotional depths in the tale that Anderson is not yet reaching, but this engaging and arresting performer has an affinity for these wealthy and free-spirited American women who hide their sadness so completely.

`HOT MIKADO' BURNS WITH ENERGY, FUN

Author: Chris Jones. Special to the Tribune.

http://turing.library.northwestern.edu/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/418319895?accountid=12861

Abstract: For seven years, Marc Robin has directed and choreographed most of the musicals at the Drury Lane Theatre in Evergreen Park. In recent months, Robin's considerable talents have become better known and his work has often shown up elsewhere in Chicagoland. But it's never hard to recognize a Robin production -- the performers never stand still for a second. Robin's voracious appetite for non-stop dance numbers can be too much at times (a great singer like Kathy Voytko should be allowed to catch her breath), but when the show is a fast-moving crowd-pleaser like David H. Bell's "Hot Mikado," Robin's energetic and peripatetic staging ensures a highly entertaining evening. With its mix of musical genres and anything-goes style, this swing version of the Gilbert and Sullivan classic allows Robin to throw in an endlessly eclectic tap number that's part Bill Robinson and part "Riverdance." In what other show could you see a multi-ethnic cast, all dressed in Japanese costumes and mocking Michael Flatley?

Full text: For seven years, Marc Robin has directed and choreographed most of the musicals at the Drury Lane Theatre in Evergreen Park. In recent months, Robin's considerable talents have become better known and his work has often shown up elsewhere in Chicagoland. But it's never hard to recognize a Robin production -- the performers never stand still for a second.
Robin's voracious appetite for non-stop dance numbers can be too much at times (a great singer like Kathy Voytko should be allowed to catch her breath), but when the show is a fast-moving crowd-pleaser like David H.

In what other show could you see a multi-ethnic cast, all dressed in Japanese costumes and mocking Michael Flatley?
Last seen here in 1993 at Marriott's Lincolnshire, "Hot Mikado" maintains the plot of the original (just as anachronistic and silly in 1885) about a pair of young lovers fighting rivals and parental execution. It features musical adaptations by Rob Bowman that are basically riffs on the original Sullivan melodies. For this free-wheeling revival, the script has been peppered with contemporary cultural references and theatrical in-jokes.
Producer John Lazzara has coaxed an A-list ensemble cast of a high caliber. The multi-talented Ron J. Hutchins reprises the role of the Mikado (Japan's ruler) and Tom Mula turns in a broad but extremely funny performance as Koko -- his hand-puppet version of "Tit Willow" sung to E. Faye Butler's incredulous Katisha is alone worth the price of admission.
Curt Dale Clark joins Voytko as the lead romantic couple while Scott Calcagno has many amusing moments as Pooh-Bah, the Lord High You Name It. Alan Donahue's Titi-Pu setting milks every possible Japanese contrivance.

MISTAKENLY, `ELEPHANT MAN' IGNORES THE HUMAN INSIDE

Author: Chris Jones. Special to the Tribune.

http://turing.library.northwestern.edu/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/418323629?accountid=12861

Abstract: In David Lynch's 1980 film of "The Elephant Man," a mass of fake, quivering flesh was attached to actor John Hurt, helping him encapsulate John Merrick, a hideously deformed 19th Century British fellow forced to become a sideshow freak. In Bernard Pomerance's acclaimed stage play of the same name, the actor playing Merrick does not have the benefit of literal celluloid prosthetics; he must move his audience by a twitch of his contorted face, forcing us to imagine the grotesque appearance described by another character in the play. Unfortunately for the current revival of "The Elephant Man" by a new company called Voxershorts, actor Kurt Naebig never makes his creation sufficiently human and empathetic for us to care about his fate. It's not entirely Naebig's fault (this is a competent if overly understated performer) because director John Swanbeck seems so obsessed with capturing the macabre world of Victorian London, he forgets to tell the story of a kind human being.

Full text: In David Lynch's 1980 film of "The Elephant Man," a mass of fake, quivering flesh was attached to actor John Hurt, helping him encapsulate John Merrick, a hideously deformed 19th Century British fellow forced to become a sideshow freak.
In Bernard Pomerance's acclaimed stage play of the same name, the actor playing Merrick does not have the benefit of literal celluloid prosthetics; he must move his audience by a twitch of his contorted face, forcing us to imagine the grotesque appearance described by another character in the play.
We must understand Merrick's journey as he emerges from his physical shell, revealing his inner sensitivity to the surgeon who gives him a home in a London hospital.
It's far from an easy role, but the feelings of the title character are the key to a powerful play that explores the painful constraints of physical appearance.
Unfortunately for the current revival of "The Elephant Man" by a new company called Voxershorts, actor Kurt Naebig never makes his creation sufficiently human and empathetic for us to care about his fate. It's not entirely Naebig's fault (this is a competent if overly understated performer) because director John Swanbeck seems so obsessed with capturing the macabre world of Victorian London, he forgets to tell the story of a kind human being.
Although there are some highly imaginative and atmospheric ideas, Swanbeck gives too much focus to the shadowy figures that occupy the edges of this play, when we really want to see the personality of the troubled man at its center.
Only once in this intermissionless production is there a moment of palpable human connection: when the visiting Mrs. Kendal (poignantly played by Roxanne Fay) reveals her breasts to Merrick, a man whose sexuality has been constantly denied him.
Despite some well-crafted moments from Rich Hutchman as Dr. Treves and solid support from the other players, this over-conceptualized production otherwise never leaves its own dark shadows.

SCALED-DOWN GERSHWIN FRESH TALENT OVERCOMES LIMITED SPACE IN `CRAZY FOR YOU'

Author: Chris Jones. Special to the Tribune.

http://turing.library.northwestern.edu/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/418334700?accountid=12861

Abstract: If they gave out grants for presenting Gershwin with gusto, Wood Dale's Stage Right Dinner Theatre would be dancing in money. In the real world, though, the 3-year-old suburban operation must live and die at the box office and the bar. That means the audiences for Stage Right's revival of the 1992 Gershwin reconception "Crazy for You" must accept some limitations. And the cast of dancers is smaller than in previous local versions of this shameless Broadway excuse to string together classic George and Ira Gershwin tunes and splashy production numbers. The silly and unimportant book by Ken Ludwig involves the saving of an old Nevada theater as locals join with New York professionals to put on a show.

Full text: If they gave out grants for presenting Gershwin with gusto, Wood Dale's Stage Right Dinner Theatre would be dancing in money.
In the real world, though, the 3-year-old suburban operation must live and die at the box office and the bar. That means the audiences for Stage Right's revival of the 1992 Gershwin reconception "Crazy for You" must accept some limitations.
Many of the non-Equity performers are fresh out of college musical-theater programs. The older characters' maturity sometimes comes from a makeup pencil.
The banquet-facility stage is wide but shallow, making blocking and transitions difficult. In the absence of a pit, the orchestra is situated to the side, causing some coordination problems for the singers.
And the cast of dancers is smaller than in previous local versions of this shameless Broadway excuse to string together classic George and Ira Gershwin tunes and splashy production numbers. The silly and unimportant book by Ken Ludwig involves the saving of an old Nevada theater as locals join with New York professionals to put on a show.
So, no one would confuse this "Crazy for You" with the touring Broadway production. But try finding parking, dinner and show for less than $40 anywhere near the Auditorium Theatre in Chicago.
The bigger suburban musical houses tend to cast similar faces, so there's a real pleasure here in seeing some new and fresh talent.
In the case of Rene Yazel, a transplanted Oklahoman playing the lead role of Polly, imaginative director Carla Rea has found a genuine and likable young performer with a strong voice and impressive dancing skills.
David Barth is a touch flustered and scattered as Bobby, but he sings and dances well.
Some of the supporting players are overly broad, but the talented ensemble really throws itself into Barbara Yokom's ambitious choreography. There's no skimping here on tough dance breaks.
All in all, this is an energetic and thoroughly entertaining evening with young artists giving their all.
So what if the eclectic male ensemble doesn't look much like traditional Broadway dancers. It's a lot easier to believe these Stage Right guys live in Nevada than those svelte triple-threats from the touring productions whom you would swear had never left Manhattan.

SHAKESPEARE REPERTORY'S `TIMON' PUTS DECADENCE ON A SIMPLER PLATTER

Author: Chris Jones. Special to the Tribune.

http://turing.library.northwestern.edu/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/418324404?accountid=12861

Abstract: Given the Gold Coast location, Shakespeare Repertory Theater openings tend to be well-coiffed affairs, with smartly dressed supporters of the financially astute company mingling and chattering on the sidewalk before the latest classical offering. At the start of Michael Bogdanov's highly provocative and superbly directed production of "Timon of Athens," the opening-night party seemed to be continuing on the stage. Shakespeare's usual penchant for self-reflective heroes, the distractions of love and meditations on the nature of honor are all kept to a minimum here. There are no multiple plot lines to keep straight in your head. Instead, the play presents a lord called Timon (Larry Yando) who lavishes gifts on a group of parasites whom he mistakes for friends, runs out of money, and then finds that his countrymen won't return his calls. Spurned by everyone save his loyal steward (gently and wisely played by Patrick Clear), the deranged Timon rails, Lear-like, against gold and humanity and quits the city and a money-grubbing populace that lives to regret its mistake. In the hands of a conceptual director like Bogdanov, this pliable play becomes a proto-Marxist treatise against the evils of capitalism. With a masterful touch for coaxing contemporary parallels that explicate the original authorial intentions, Bogdanov uses a cast of white males (the few women in this play are mainly hookers) to indict Anglo-American materialism. Men smoke cigars, drink in cocktail bars (watch for a pun on the Shakespearean use of "happy hour") and paw exotic dancers. And a pounding jazz-fusion score implies Bogdanov is writing an unkind obituary of the 1980s.

Full text: Given the Gold Coast location, Shakespeare Repertory Theater openings tend to be well-coiffed affairs, with smartly dressed supporters of the financially astute company mingling and chattering on the sidewalk before the latest classical offering. At the start of Michael Bogdanov's highly provocative and superbly directed production of "Timon of Athens," the opening-night party seemed to be continuing on the stage.
Hors d'oeuvres passed through an aisle. A familiar usher stood on stage with a glass of champagne as a photographer shot a roll of film. And with Hitchcockian insouciance, the British director himself could be spotted smiling and mingling with actors dressed like most of the audience.
All of this contrived decadence was, of course, a prologue to Bogdanov's contemporary rendition of one of Shakespeare's least frequently produced but most thematically concise plays. Regardless of concept or period, "Timon of Athens" is mainly about the destructive power of cash.
Shakespeare's usual penchant for self-reflective heroes, the distractions of love and meditations on the nature of honor are all kept to a minimum here. There are no multiple plot lines to keep straight in your head. Instead, the play presents a lord called Timon (Larry Yando) who lavishes gifts on a group of parasites whom he mistakes for friends, runs out of money, and then finds that his countrymen won't return his calls. Spurned by everyone save his loyal steward (gently and wisely played by Patrick Clear), the deranged Timon rails, Lear-like, against gold and humanity and quits the city and a money-grubbing populace that lives to regret its mistake.
In the hands of a conceptual director like Bogdanov, this pliable play becomes a proto-Marxist treatise against the evils of capitalism. With a masterful touch for coaxing contemporary parallels that explicate the original authorial intentions, Bogdanov uses a cast of white males (the few women in this play are mainly hookers) to indict Anglo-American materialism. Men smoke cigars, drink in cocktail bars (watch for a pun on the Shakespearean use of "happy hour") and paw exotic dancers. And a pounding jazz-fusion score implies Bogdanov is writing an unkind obituary of the 1980s.
His definitive directorial pen moves on a clever canvas. Evoking a decayed and decadent urban wasteland, Ralph Koltai's scenic design seems at once sparse and overflowing with stuff.
In many ways, the actors have to fight for attention amid all of these visual ideas. But there is some multi-layered work on display, especially from David Darlow as Apemantus, the play's cynical voice and (in a small but memorable part), Scott Parkinson as a parasitic painter.
The always fascinating Yando has some moments of true bravura in the difficult title role, shifting adeptly from patrician ruler to misanthropic dropout. Yet Timon's pseudotragic second-act fate leaves one surprisingly unmoved.
That's also a problem with the script. But if Timon lacks tragic status, it crackles with contemporary relevance.
"Promising is the very air of the time," declares one nasty character, looking to collect. With Bogdanov's help, one would swear that Shakespeare was writing about running up a balance on a credit card.

`THE BEATS' LETS THE POSTWAR POETS SPEAK FOR THEMSELVES

Author: Jones, Chris

http://turing.library.northwestern.edu/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/418302550?accountid=12861

Abstract: Earlier this month, director Kate Buckley was rehearsing in Glencoe with her company of actors for "The Beats," a performance tribute to those American writers of the postwar era, when word filtered down of the death of Allen Ginsberg. The demise of the celebrated poet and the renewed attention it has given to his work has also given this production, by Writers' Theatre Chicago, an unexpected timeliness. Adapted for the stage by Marilyn Campbell, "The Beats" is an episodic five-actor journey through the letters, poetry and prose of such writers as Ginsberg, Gregory Corso, Gary Snyder, Diane di Prima, Jack Kerouac, John Clellon Holmes and Lawrence Ferlinghetti.

Full text: Earlier this month, director Kate Buckley was rehearsing in Glencoe with her company of actors for "The Beats," a performance tribute to those American writers of the postwar era, when word filtered down of the death of Allen Ginsberg.
"That evening, we had been playing around with some of Ginsberg's stuff," Buckley says. "His death was a very grounding experience."
The demise of the celebrated poet and the renewed attention it has given to his work has also given this production, by Writers' Theatre Chicago, an unexpected timeliness. Adapted for the stage by Marilyn Campbell, "The Beats" is an episodic five-actor journey through the letters, poetry and prose of such writers as Ginsberg, Gregory Corso, Gary Snyder, Diane di Prima, Jack Kerouac, John Clellon Holmes and Lawrence Ferlinghetti.
"There are so many preconceptions about their identities," Buckley says. "People think they were a bunch of bongo-loving loser-beatniks. That was just a media attack that all the kids from the suburbs began playing into. They were actually writing about the importance of listening to your own voice and being true to yourself."
Located in a back room of Books on Vernon since 1992, the Writers' Theatre is the brainchild of Michael Halberstam. The out-of-the-way theater space has only about 50 seats, but Halberstam says it will be transformed for this show into an environmental coffee house nothing like the big book chains' espresso emporia. Plenty of jazz will be underscoring the actors' words. Halberstam says he's happy that his usually European-centered troupe is highlighting a uniquely American movement.
And Buckley says, "We're all still going to poetry slams at the Green Mill. These guys (the Beat poets) started that whole format. And their words still move me 20 years after I first read them."

"The Beats" continues Thursdays-Sundays through June 1 at Books on Vernon, 664 Vernon Ave., Glencoe. For more information, call 847-835-5398.

`FIRES' MESSAGE STILL BURNS BRIGHT NORTHLIGHT THEATRE REVIVES POWERFUL EXAMINATION OF RACIAL MISTRUST

Author: Chris Jones. Special to the Tribune.

http://turing.library.northwestern.edu/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/418335886?accountid=12861

Abstract: For anyone who saw Anna Deavere Smith perform her one-woman exploration of race relations in America either live or on television, "Fires in the Mirror: Crown Heights, Brooklyn and Other Identities" will forever be associated with Smith's uncommon ability to impersonate 21 characters in 90 minutes, and make you believe that she sees inside their very souls. Smith has now moved on to other projects. "Fires," meanwhile, exists as a published text, and under Russell Vandenbroucke's direction, it's currently playing at the Northlight Theatre's new Skokie home. In Skokie, Vandenbroucke chose an African-American woman (Cheryl Lynn Bruce) and a Jewish man (Fredric Stone) to split Smith's characters without regard to race or sex. Therein lies the undeniable power of Vandenbroucke's courageous concept. Smith's message here is that if we listen to the fears, history and dreams of other racial groups, we can better understand their points of view. Watching the excellent and self-effacing Stone play black activist Leonard Jeffries (detested by most Jews) is fascinating.

Full text: For anyone who saw Anna Deavere Smith perform her one-woman exploration of race relations in America either live or on television, "Fires in the Mirror: Crown Heights, Brooklyn and Other Identities" will forever be associated with Smith's uncommon ability to impersonate 21 characters in 90 minutes, and make you believe that she sees inside their very souls.
Smith has now moved on to other projects. "Fires," meanwhile, exists as a published text, and under Russell Vandenbroucke's direction, it's currently playing at the Northlight Theatre's new Skokie home.
The continuing life of this play is a very good thing. There simply is no other contemporary dramatic piece confronting the issue of racial mistrust with such force and insight.
Smith forged this oral history from the unrest that erupted in 1991 in the Brooklyn neighborhood of Crown Heights. The spark for this urban fire was the death of a black 7-year-old who was run over by a car from the entourage of a Lubovitcher Grand Rebbe. Shortly afterwards, a visiting professor from Australia was stabbed, a Jewish victim of the boiling anger between the Hasidic community and local African-Americans.
Over a period of two weeks, Smith interviewed many of the interested parties. In "Fires," the empowered and the disempowered simply present their views of the incident in their own words.
In Skokie, Vandenbroucke chose an African-American woman (Cheryl Lynn Bruce) and a Jewish man (Fredric Stone) to split Smith's characters without regard to race or sex. Therein lies the undeniable power of Vandenbroucke's courageous concept. Smith's message here is that if we listen to the fears, history and dreams of other racial groups, we can better understand their points of view. Watching the excellent and self-effacing Stone play black activist Leonard Jeffries (detested by most Jews) is fascinating.
Bruce was still grappling with the lengthy text on opening night, but her work already has quiet power. These two intense and heartfelt performances will likely mesh further as the run continues.
If only the audience reflected the diversity on stage: Smith's writing works best when we learn not just about the author and her material but about each other.

Abstract: "Paddywack": With bomb threats from the Irish Republican Army sounding across England prior to its general election, Daniel Magee's drama, "Paddywack,"about a young Irishman who moves into a British boarding house only to find that his roommates suspect he is a terrorist is a very topical play. The British are not treated sympathetically in Magee's hard-bitten, 90-minute play. But even if there are some simplistic and sexist themes here, this is a taut and tense piece of writing that raises important issues about perception and race. Newcomer Lisa Devine keeps her Profiles Performance Ensemble production moving at a rapid paceunderscoring transitions with abrasive rock music. The shocking climax of the production is not entirely successful, but there are many intense scenes and some provocative acting work from, especially, Chris Farrell and Darrell W. Cox as the misunderstood Irishman.
